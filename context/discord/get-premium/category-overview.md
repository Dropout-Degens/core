## Notes from Strategy Meetings

- The old framing was "pay $15/month for picks." The new framing should be:
  - Here's what you learn and get access to (education, tools, EV optimizer, community)
  - Here's how you can get it FREE by signing up with partner codes
  - We charge $50/month because the value is real — but most members never pay
- Subscription price moving from $15 to $50/month
- The "free through partners" angle is the key conversion mechanism — partnership revenue is 25x subscription revenue
- Premium features should showcase the five educational pillars:
  1. Partner Promo Optimization
  2. Line Shopping
  3. Bankroll Management
  4. Value Identification (EV analysis)
  5. Arbitrage Opportunities
