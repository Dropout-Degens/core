**Priority:** HIGH — Core educational content lives here. This is where the education pivot is most visible.

## Notes from Strategy Meetings

- **Dante's key feedback:** partners aren't visible enough in channels for staff to naturally reference them. This category needs to make partner tools front-and-center as educational resources, not sales pitches.
- **Betting tips** should be the educational hub — line shopping, bankroll management, EV analysis, arbitrage concepts.
- **Our partners** needs reframing from "use code DROPOUTS" to "here are the tools that will make you a smarter bettor, and here's why each one matters."
- **Partner promos** — bot-driven, shows claimable promos by jurisdiction/age. Needs data corrections (e.g., Onyx incorrectly showing for CT).
- **Server guide** — needs full rewrite once channel structure is finalized.
