## Notes from Strategy Meetings

- **Daily poll** is a JP KPI — should be posted daily for karma engagement.
- **Daily free picks** — currently framed as "DFS partner of the day." Education pivot reframe: which partner tool is being featured today and why it's valuable.
- **Community picks** — was called "community-picks" (formerly had train emoji). Members share slips here. Good for engagement.
- **Ladder challenge** — no topic set. May be inactive. Needs decision: keep, update, or archive.
- **Greened out** — win totals need to be calculated historically (mentioned in meetings as a data need).
- The community is described as "dying" — target is 20+ active premium members chatting daily.
