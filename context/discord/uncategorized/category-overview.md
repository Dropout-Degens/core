# Uncategorized Channels

**Priority:** HIGH — These are first-impression channels.

## Channels

| Channel | Current Topic | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| lobby-entrance | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs review — first thing members see? |
| rules | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs review |

## Notes

- These sit outside any category. Lobby entrance is likely the first channel new members land in.
- Rules channel needs to reflect the education-first community values: transparency, helpfulness, responsible gaming, no putting down members.
