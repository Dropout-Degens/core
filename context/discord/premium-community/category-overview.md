# PREMIUM COMMUNITY Category

**Priority:** HIGH — This is where premium members get the education-first experience.

## Channels

|---------|--------------|--------|
| premium-announcements | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs topic + content |
| members-chat | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs topic |
| the-lab | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs topic + define purpose |
| cheat-sheets | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs topic + content |
| bot-plays | (no topic set) | TODO: Needs topic + define purpose |

## Notes from Strategy Meetings

- None of these channels have topics set — this is a problem for the education pivot.
- **The lab** — unclear current purpose. Could be the educational experimentation space.
- **Cheat sheets** — should contain quick-reference guides for line shopping, unit sizing, partner promo claiming, etc.
- **Bot plays** — likely for automated/bot-generated picks. Needs clarity on how this fits education framing.
- **Members chat** — premium version of general chat. Where the 20+ active daily members target applies.
- This whole category needs a content strategy that demonstrates why premium is worth $50/month.
