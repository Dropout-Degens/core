## Notes from Strategy Meetings

- **Welcome tickets are currently BROKEN** — every new user should get a ticket that mods onboard through
- **Premium walkthrough** — every new trial/sub member gets an individualized ticket where staff proactively help them maximize their advantage. Key retention mechanism.
- **Expired sub** — automated ticket when subscription/trial ends to re-engage
- **Responsible gaming** — needs resources, tips (bankroll management, unit systems), support phone numbers, link to Layup as non-gambling alternative. Dax said "I don't know really what I want to do for this channel" — needs content strategy.
- **Server welcome** — members from high-converting sources get 3-day trial in-server + 7-day via DM (up to 10 free days). Goal: immediate engagement and conversion.
