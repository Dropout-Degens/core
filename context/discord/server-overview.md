## Education Pivot Status

The following categories are the HIGHEST PRIORITY for content updates to reflect the education-first positioning:

1. **SUPPORT** - Welcome flow, premium walkthrough, free access claims, responsible gaming
2. **RESOURCES + PARTNERS** - Betting tips, partner info, server guide — core educational content
3. **GET PREMIUM** - Reframe from "buy access" to "here's what you learn + how to get it free"
4. **GENERAL CHAT** - Announcements, daily picks framing, community engagement
5. **PREMIUM COMMUNITY** - The lab, cheat sheets, bot plays — educational value prop
6. **Uncategorized** (lobby-entrance, rules) - First impression for new members

## Cleanup Needed

- **EV BACKLOG** — 17 channels, many likely outdated. Dax mentioned deleting old data and keeping hockey as historical reference.
- **HIDDEN CHANNELS** — 32 channels including old analyst picks, old EV channels. Decide what to archive vs delete.
- **ARCHIVED SUPPORT** — Old tickets. Can likely be ignored for content purposes.
- **Roles** — 78 roles, many Notify-* roles with 0 members. Several bot roles with 0 members (Whop Bot, Pine Sports, etc.)
