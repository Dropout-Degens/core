# ASAP Action Plan — February 7, 2026

**Goal:** Raise pricing to $50/month. Everything below feeds into making that justifiable.

---

## 1. PUBLISH EV (Highest Priority)

### EV Information Channel
- **Purge the entire channel** — start fresh
- Update with accurate info about how DD's EV system works
- Show the publicly viewable EV/DFS data as proof of methodology
- Frame it so people see it and think "this is really impressive, they have real data"
- The secret algorithm stays secret — but show the general approach to evaluating markets

### NHL EV — DEADLINE: Late March (season returns)
- **Have ~1-2 weeks to get this done**
- If AWS is too hard, fall back to Google Sheets (same data, just different hosting)
- Copy a new copy of the DFS sheet, focus ONLY on hockey
- This is the one to nail before season comes back

### Fliff EV — Call with Zach (Bellcube)
- Fliff EV IS published but **sending to wrong channels**
- Need to fix so it sends to Fliff-only channel, not the others
- This is an ASAP fix for Zach

### New Hockey EV
- Release the new hockey EV channel
- ASAP priority

## 2. UPDATE TICKETING SYSTEM

### Premium Walkthrough (ASAP)
- Every new trial/sub member gets a personalized ticket
- Approach: Mom Test style — ask what are your pains, then show solutions
- Need to build out a question flow / question bot
- Staff proactively help members maximize their advantage

### Expired Sub Ticket
- When sub/trial ends, automated ticket opens
- Messaging: "We must have failed you somehow — what can we do to fix that?"
- Ask: Have you found value from X, Y, Z?
- Offer: Sign up with a partner, normally 7 free days, but through this re-engagement ticket get **14 free days**
- Goal: understand where value failed + convert to partner

### Other Ticket Types
- All ticket types need updated staff tags in audit log
- Tags will be different per channel (some = staff + mod, some = staff + head staff, etc.)
- Will figure out specifics as we go through each channel

---

## 3. STAFF CLEANUP & VISIBILITY

### Remove Old Staff
- Old staff need to log in to website and have roles removed
- Anyone not actively on staff should not have staff roles

### Get Profile (Admin) Updates
- **Question for Zach:** Do staff have access to Get Profile Admin or just Get Profile?
- Want to add to the profile view:
  - State (from partner promo bot data)
  - Age range (18+, 21+, etc.)
  - Bankroll info
  - Where they came from (join source)
  - Membership history (how many times, paid or not)

### Lobby Entrance — Capture Location on Join
- When new members join, capture where they're from
- Display it so staff can assess conversion potential

### Audit Log Staff Tags
- Update tags per channel — different staff teams get tagged for different channels
- Will define specifics channel by channel

---

## 4. STAFF OPERATIONS

### Analyst Weekly Meeting
- All analysts in one call, weekly
- Agenda: Who's doing best this week? Are we converting? Tracking spreadsheet updates?
- Propose 3 time options in group chat: Monday, Wednesday 10am, or Friday
- If they can't make it, they must schedule a 1-on-1
- **Want analysts to be proactive**
- Put on calendar for next week

### Luke
- Haven't talked to him yet — was moving last week
- Texted to see if he can chat this weekend or sometime next week

### JP Weekly
- Start weekly 1-on-1 with JP next week

### Nanu
- No other mods besides JP. Nanu is prospective but on hold.

### Analyst Onboarding
- All analysts need to be onboarded for conversions
- Set up their percentages where applicable
- Need to start being more engaged in the server

---

## 5. UPDATE CONTENT & STRATEGIES

### Betting Tips
- Current content is good but needs updating
- Need to add much more strategy content
- This is ongoing over the next few months

### All Channel Content
- Every channel needs a content review and update
- Channel-by-channel breakdown exists in `core/context/discord/`
- Will go through each one

### Onboarding Flow
- New members land in lobby → rules channel
- Whole onboarding flow needs updating
- 200 new people coming over the next 3 months from $200 promotion
- They'll be testing our onboarding — need to validate positioning with them

---

## 6. RE-ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGN

- Message literally every person in the database individually via Discord DMs
- Messaging: "Sorry it took so long, been getting staff onboarded and looking through data"
- "Development is in cycle, X feature releasing by Y date"
- Push people to engage in the server instead of DMs: "Please tag me there"

---

## 7. OPERATIONS (Next Priority After Content)

### Backend Database
- Update expenses tracking
- Update partnership data

### Development Agenda for Zach
- Need to prepare an agenda: ASAP must-dos + things Dax is working on that Zach needs to approve
- Zach has a few things he needs to push ASAP
- Dev conversation is separate — not for this session

---
