# Dropout Degens — Operations Reference Documentation

**Created:** February 2026
**Owner:** Dax (CEO)

---

## Purpose

These are internal reference documents for Dax and AI context. They consolidate compensation, expectations, and operational policies that were previously scattered across individual meeting transcripts into persistent, canonical policy documentation.

When a policy question comes up (e.g., "what's the analyst base rate?" or "how does the bonus pool work?"), these docs are the source of truth — not individual meeting notes.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Total Revenue** | Subscription revenue + partnership revenue for a given month |
| **Bonus Funds (20%)** | Business reinvestment fund taken off the top. Covers marketing, operating costs, reserves. NOT distributed to staff. |
| **Operational Pool (80%)** | Revenue remaining after bonus funds. Staff compensation comes from here. |
| **Staff Bonus Pool (5%)** | Separate allocation from total revenue, distributed to staff proportionally by conversion points. |
| **Conversion Points** | Points earned by staff through partner signups (1pt), premium member recruitment via invite link (3pt), or both (double points). |
| **CPA** | Cost per acquisition. DD earns ~$50 per partner conversion from its affiliate partners. |
| **LTV** | Lifetime value per customer. ~$1,500 across all available partnership conversions. |
| **Promobot** | Discord bot that shows members which partner promos are available in their state. Being expanded with ticket automation. |

## Source Material

These documents were synthesized from the following meeting transcripts and context files:

| Meeting | Key Policies Established |
|---------|------------------------|
| JP 2026-01-28 | 20% bonus funds, head staff 10% allocation, 5-conversion minimum concept |
| Kaiden 2026-01-29 | Analyst onboarding, education-first philosophy, daily tasks |
| Kaiden 2026-02-03 | Bonus pool mechanics, double points, ticket system engagement, priority ranking |
| Dante 2026-02-01 | Stepped back from compensation, bet tracking feedback (enter immediately) |
| Nanu 2026-02-01 | Bonus pool only, 1-conversion minimum, bet tracking tool evaluation |
| Mark 2026-02-06 | 2% confirmed with 5-conv minimum, 3pt premium recruitment, $50/month pivot, bet tracking spreadsheet |
| Arsam 2026-02-06 | Standard 2% offer, revenue context shared, buyout discussion |

## Maintenance

- **Update these docs** whenever compensation, allocation, or role policies change
- Each doc has a "Last Updated" date and a "Change Log" section at the bottom
- These docs **supersede** individual meeting notes for policy questions — if a meeting note conflicts with these docs, these docs are canonical
- The 20% bonus funds vs. 5% staff bonus pool distinction is the most common source of confusion — earlier meeting notes (JP Jan 28, Kaiden Feb 3) used imprecise language that has been corrected here
