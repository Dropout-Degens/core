# Staff Compensation Structure

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026
**Owner:** Dax (CEO)

---

## Overview

All staff compensation is percentage-based on total monthly revenue. Total revenue = subscription revenue + partnership revenue. Percentages are calculated on total revenue (not on the 80% operational pool — see `revenue-allocation.md` for why this is equivalent). Payments are monthly.

## Revenue Allocation Summary

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Bonus Funds | 20% | Business reinvestment (not staff pay) |
| Head Staff | ~10% | JP, Dante (contingent), Zach |
| Analysts | ~2% each | Base compensation per analyst |
| Staff Bonus Pool | 5% | Distributed by conversion points |
| Remainder | Variable | Founder compensation (Dax) |

## Head Staff (~10% Total)

### JP (Head Moderator) — 4%

- **Base:** 4% of monthly revenue
- **Status:** Active
- **Eligibility:** Under review whether 5 conversions/month minimum applies to JP's base
- **Also eligible for:** 5% staff bonus pool (see `conversion-bonus-system.md`)

### Dante (formerly Head Analyst) — 4% Contingent

- **Base:** 4% was allocated but contingent on continued activity
- **Current status:** Stepped back to All-Access member as of February 2026
- **Compensation:** None — Dante explicitly declined payment due to limited availability

- **Possible return:** Dante said he may come back in 1-2 months. Percentage would be revisited at that point.

## Analyst Compensation

### Standard Rate: 2% of Monthly Revenue

All analysts are offered the same base rate for consistency. The 2% is calculated on total monthly revenue (subscription + partnership).

**Eligibility requirement:** Minimum 5 conversions per month. If an analyst does not hit 5 conversions, they receive no base pay for that month but may still participate in the 5% bonus pool (subject to the same 5-conversion eligibility threshold — see `conversion-bonus-system.md`).

### Mark — 2% (Confirmed)

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Minimum:** 5 conversions/month
- **Status:** Active, confirmed February 6, 2026
- **Also eligible for:** 5% staff bonus pool
- **Unique:** California location (limited partner access), DFS and offshore experience, Platinum Algezine
- **Source:** Mark 2026-02-06 meeting

### Kaiden — Base TBD

- **Base:** Not yet set. Kaiden explicitly said he does not care about compensation right now.
- **Status:** Active, onboarded January 29, 2026
- **Also eligible for:** 5% staff bonus pool (included immediately regardless of base)
- **Expected:** Will transition to standard 2% when formalized
- **Unique:** NBA prediction model (up 17-18 units), FSU college student, Snapchat group with ~50 betting friends, girlfriend has 140K TikTok followers
- **Source:** Kaiden 2026-01-29 onboarding, 2026-02-03 check-in

### Arsam — 2% (Offered, Not Accepted)

- **Base:** Standard 2% analyst rate was offered February 6, 2026
- **Status:** No agreement reached. Arsam is discussing with his partner Heiko before committing.
- **Also discussed:** Conversion-based arrangement (heavier weight on conversions, less traditional analyst), potential server buyout ($10K offer declined by Dax)
- **Unique:** Tennis live betting specialist, AT&T sales experience, runs BigBetLounge Discord with Heiko
- **Source:** Arsam 2026-02-06 external meeting

### Dante — Opted Out

- **Base:** None (explicitly declined)
- **Status:** Stepped back from analyst to All-Access member
- **Reason:** Limited availability, doesn't want to take payment for minimal contribution

## Moderator Compensation

### JP — 4% (See Head Staff Above)

JP's 4% base covers both his head staff and moderator responsibilities.

### Nanu — Bonus Pool Only

- **Base:** None (no base percentage)
- **Status:** Prospective moderator (on hold, assessing job workload)
- **Eligible for:** 5% staff bonus pool
- **Minimum for bonus payout:** 1 conversion per month
- **Responsibilities:** Welcome tickets, community engagement, partner visibility, conversions

## Payment Process

### Timing
- Monthly
- Dax tallies all revenue and conversions at end of month
- Payouts made after tallying is complete
- No mid-month advances or partial payments

### What Dax Does at End of Month
1. Calculate total revenue (subscription + partnership) for the month
2. Verify conversion counts per staff member against proof in #partner-attribution
3. Determine eligibility (did each person hit their minimum?)
4. Calculate base payouts (percentage x total revenue)
5. Calculate bonus pool payouts (see `conversion-bonus-system.md` for formula)
6. Distribute payments

### Payment Method
- Not formalized yet as of February 2026
- Currently informal — Dax pays directly
- Tax consideration: $600 annual reporting threshold noted. Dax is keeping partnership claims under $600 per individual for tax purposes where possible.

---

## Edge Cases

### Staff Joins Mid-Month
- Prorated at Dax's discretion based on days active
- Bonus pool points are earned from start date (no proration of pool itself)

### Very Low Revenue Month
- Percentages still apply — dollar amounts will be minimal
- Example: $500 revenue → Mark's 2% = $10, JP's 4% = $20
- Staff should understand that compensation scales with revenue

### Dante's 4% Vacancy
- Currently unassigned and reverts to Dax/reserve
- If a new head analyst is appointed, this allocation could be reassigned
- Not automatically distributed to other staff

### Staff Member Leaves
- Base percentage is unallocated immediately
- Any earned bonus pool points for the current month are still paid out
- Tracked invite link attribution continues (persistent links)

### Multiple Analysts at 2% Each
- Each analyst gets their own 2% — these are not shared
- With 4 analysts at 2% = 8% total analyst allocation
- Combined with head staff 10% + bonus pool 5% = potential 23% to staff
- Remainder to Dax decreases as team grows

## Projected Growth Impact

| Revenue | Bonus Funds (20%) | JP (4%) | Mark (2%) | Zach (2%) | Bonus Pool (5%) | Dax Remainder |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| $1,000 | $200 | $40 | $20 | $20 | $50 | $670 |
| $2,000 | $400 | $80 | $40 | $40 | $100 | $1,340 |
| $5,000 | $1,000 | $200 | $100 | $100 | $250 | $3,350 |
| $10,000 | $2,000 | $400 | $200 | $200 | $500 | $6,700 |

**Note:** Table assumes only Mark as active analyst at 2%. Adding Kaiden (2%) and potentially Arsam (2%) would reduce Dax's remainder by $20-$40 per $1K revenue per analyst.
