# Analyst Requirements & Expectations

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026
**Owner:** Dax (CEO)

## Philosophy: Education First

Dropout Degens is NOT a picks service. It is an education-first sports betting community. The positioning is:

> "Empowering sports bettors with access to the resources and knowledge that they need to define and take advantage of profitable markets right inside our Discord."

Analysts are expected to:
- Explain the **why** behind every pick — which tools were used, what data informed the decision, why the line has value
- Help members become smarter bettors, not create dependency on tailing
- Reference integrated tools in picks: OddsJam, Novig, Kelly criterion, Outlier data, Props Cache, Daily Grind Fantasy
- Frame partner recommendations around educational value and "free money" positioning (bonus bets, deposit matches)
- Differentiate from the typical Discord that just says "our picks hit" — DD teaches members to evaluate and validate picks themselves

This is the core differentiator. Every other picks Discord promotes on win rate. DD promotes on education and tools.

## Picks Posting

### Frequency
- **Not daily mandatory**, but must be consistent
- Target: every other day minimum when schedule allows
- Missing one day is fine. Going 4 days dark, posting once, then disappearing for 3 more days is not acceptable.
- If you can't post for an extended period, communicate with Dax in advance
- Quality and education over volume — do not post picks just to post

### Content Standards
Every posted pick should include:
- The pick itself (team, line, odds, book)
- **Reasoning:** Why you're taking this — what does the data show?
- **Tools referenced:** Which tools informed this pick (OddsJam EV, Novig de-vig, model output, outlier data, etc.)
- **Unit sizing:** How many units, and optionally why (Kelly output, confidence level)

**Good example:** "Taking Pacers +4.5 on FanDuel at -110. Novig de-vigs to +3.8 true line from Pinnacle, giving us 0.7 points of edge. Kelly quarter suggests 1.2 units on a $500 bankroll. Pacers are 7-3 ATS in their last 10 as underdogs."

**Bad example:** "Pacers +4.5 tonight. Lock it in."

---

## Daily Recaps

- For every day picks are sent, post a recap **before** the next day's picks go out
- Show results: what hit, what missed
- Briefly explain what happened — why did a pick miss? Was the reasoning sound but the outcome bad? Or was it a bad read?
- This reinforces transparency and accountability
- Format: simple text in the analyst channel. Does not need to be a graphic.

---

## Screenshots

### What to Post
- Screenshots of your bet slips from sportsbook apps
- Screenshots of the apps themselves (home screens, EV tools, promo pages)
- Screenshots of research tools being used (OddsJam, Novig calculator, Algezine, etc.)

### Why This Matters
- **Drives partner awareness:** Every time a member sees an app, it's an opportunity for them to say "what app is that?" and potentially convert
- **Builds trust:** Skin in the game. Members see you're actually betting, not just talking.
- **Creates conversation:** Screenshots are natural conversation starters in channels

### Guidelines
- Dollar amounts: **optional** — up to the analyst's comfort level
- Showing the app is what matters, not the dollar amount
- DFS app screenshots are especially valuable (Underdog, PrizePicks, etc.) since many members have access to these
- Post in both your analyst channel AND relevant sport channels (e.g., NBA screenshot in the NBA channel with an explanation)

---

## Seeding Engagement

These are small daily tasks that take minutes but keep the server feeling alive:

- **Vote on the daily poll** (every day)
- **React in these channels daily:**
  - Daily free picks
  - Partner promos
  - Greened out
  - Community picks

This signals to members that staff cares and is present. In a low-activity server, every reaction matters.

---

## Channel Activity

- Be active in **5+ assigned channels** — general chat, members chat, 1-2 betting floor channels, and the lab or cheat sheets/bot places
- Participate in conversations, answer questions, contribute to discussions
- Build genuine relationships with active members
- Help retain members that Dax brings back through his outreach campaigns
- When members ask questions (especially newer bettors like O Sweater), take the time to answer and educate
- Communication style: casual and authentic, not corporate. Sports talk is encouraged.

---

## Conversions

### Minimum Requirement
- **5 partner conversions per month** required to be eligible for both the 2% base pay AND the 5% bonus pool
- This is the single most important metric for analyst compensation eligibility

### How to Drive Conversions
- Natural approach: when helping a member, reference tools and apps that are DD partners
- Position partner signups as "free money" — deposit matches, bonus bets, sign-up promos
- Use the Promobot to show members what's available in their state
- Post screenshots of partner apps being used (creates organic interest)
- Explain the value proposition: "You get a $100 deposit match, AND you get 7 free days of premium"

### Proof Process
For each conversion:
1. Take a screenshot of the member's signup confirmation
2. Tag the member in **#partner-attribution**
3. Include the partner name
4. Dax verifies at end of month

See `conversion-bonus-system.md` for full details on the points system.

## Welcome Tickets

- When the ticket system launches, every new server join gets an auto-created ticket
- Analysts should **help answer unanswered tickets when available**
- This is not the primary responsibility (mods own this), but analyst participation is valued
- Treat it as an opportunity: make a good first impression, point new members to tools, and drive initial partner signups
- Goal per ticket: get the new member to claim at least one partner promo and/or start a free trial

---

## Member Recruitment

- Use your **tracked invite link** to recruit new members
- Each premium member who joins through your link = **3 conversion points** (high value)
- Leverage personal networks: friends, school, social media, other Discord communities
- Position DD as education and free money, not a picks service
- The 7-day free trial with payment info is the target: gets them into the premium system
- Kaiden's example: Snapchat group chat with ~50 FSU students who bet on sports

---

## Bet Tracking

- Keep the **standardized bet tracking spreadsheet** up to date
- Update **immediately** when plays are posted, not retroactively
- See `bet-tracking-requirements.md` for field specifications and format
- Dax provides the pre-formatted spreadsheet and a ChatGPT link for auto-formatting
- This data feeds into the Bankroll Capital AI chatbot and is used for analyst evaluation

---

## Layup Referrals (Optional)

- $50 gift card per successful referral to Layup (Dax's internship company)
- Help identify people in the community who could benefit from Layup's sports betting tools
- Not a formal requirement, but an additional earning opportunity
- Mark has already referred "Huddy" and has potential for more

---

## What "Good" Looks Like

- Consistent presence — even on days picks aren't posted, you're in channels engaging
- Education-first framing in all content — members learn from your posts
- Active in channels daily — reactions, conversations, answering questions
- Meeting or exceeding the 5-conversion monthly minimum
- Bet tracking kept current — no gaps, no retroactive filling
- Responsive to member questions — especially newer members
- Screenshots posted with picks — showing the apps and the reasoning
- Communicating proactively — if you'll be inactive for a few days, let Dax know

## What "Bad" Looks Like

- Going dark for multiple days without communication
- Posting picks without any reasoning or context ("just take the over")
- Not tracking bets or tracking them retroactively in bulk
- Zero conversions for the month
- Not engaging in channels or reacting to daily content
- Forcing picks when there's no edge (posting bad picks just to post something)
- Treating DD like a picks service instead of an education community
- Ignoring new members or ticket requests

---

## Time Commitment

- Everyone has school, jobs, and life outside DD. No specific hours are required.
- What matters is **consistency** and **quality**, not volume.
- High-impact activities in priority order (from Kaiden 2026-02-03 meeting):
  1. Ticket system engagement (once launched)
  2. Partner conversions and verification
  3. Network recruitment (personal contacts, invite link)
  4. Community presence and chat activity
  5. Content creation and analysis sharing
