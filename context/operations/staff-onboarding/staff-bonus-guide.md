# Dropout Degens — Staff Bonus Guide

This document explains how the staff bonus pool works, how you earn points, and how payouts are calculated.

---

## How It Works

Every month, **5% of total server revenue** goes into a staff bonus pool. That pool gets split among all eligible staff based on the **conversion points** they earned that month. More points = bigger share of the pool.

---

## How You Earn Points

There are three ways to earn conversion points:

### 1. Partner Conversions — 1 Point Each

When a member signs up on any of our ~40 partner apps using a DD referral code, you earn **1 point** if you're the one who drove that conversion.

**How to claim it:**
1. Take a screenshot of the member's signup
2. Go to the **#partner-attribution** channel
3. Tag the member and name the partner
4. Dax verifies at the end of the month

### 2. Premium Member Recruitment — 3 Points Each

When someone joins the server through **your tracked invite link** and then subscribes to premium (even through the free trial), you earn **3 points**.

You don't need to do anything extra to claim this — invite link tracking is automatic. Just share your link and get people into the server.

### 3. Double Points — Invite + Convert

If you bring someone in through your invite link (3 points) AND that same person signs up for a partner (1 point), you get credit for **both**. That's 4 points from a single member.

## How the Pool Is Divided

At the end of each month, Dax adds up all the conversion points earned by all staff. Your payout is based on your share of the total points.

**Formula:**
```
Your Payout = (Your Points / Total Points) x Bonus Pool
```

### Example

Let's say the server made $2,000 this month. The bonus pool is 5% = **$100**.

| Staff Member | Points Earned | Share | Payout |
|-------------|--------------|-------|--------|
| You | 7 | 70% | $70 |
| Another analyst | 2 | 20% | $20 |
| A moderator | 1 | 10% | $10 |
| **Total** | **10** | **100%** | **$100** |

The more points you earn relative to everyone else, the bigger your share.

---

## Eligibility

You need a minimum number of conversions to receive a bonus pool payout:

| Role | Minimum Conversions |
|------|-------------------|
| Analyst | 5 per month |
| Moderator | 1 per month |

If you don't hit your minimum, your points for that month don't count and the pool is distributed among those who do qualify.

---

## What Counts as a "Conversion"

A conversion is when a member takes an action on one of our partners that earns DD revenue:

- Signing up for a sportsbook app using a DD promo code
- Claiming a partner offer through our Promobot in Discord
- Any partner signup where the DD referral is attributed

It does NOT count if:
- The member didn't use a DD code or link
- There's no proof of the signup
- The signup was on a non-partner app

---

## Your Invite Link

You'll get a unique invite link from the Dropout Degens bot. This link is permanent — use the same one all the time.

**Where to share it:**
- Friends and personal networks
- Social media
- Other Discord communities
- Group chats

Every member who comes in through your link is tracked. If they go premium, you get 3 points automatically.

---

## Proof & Attribution

For partner conversions (the 1-point ones), you need to submit proof:

1. **Screenshot** of the member's signup or confirmation
2. **Post in #partner-attribution** with:
   - The member's Discord tag
   - The partner name (e.g., "Underdog", "Bet105", "Fliff")
3. Dax reviews and verifies at the end of the month

For premium invite link points (the 3-point ones), tracking is automatic — no proof needed from you.

---

## When You Get Paid

- Payouts are **monthly**
- Dax tallies all conversions and points at the end of each month
- Bonus pool payouts are made alongside your base compensation (if applicable)
- Points reset each month — they don't carry over

---

## Tips for Earning More Points

- **Post screenshots of partner apps** — when members see an app, they get curious and sign up
- **Share your invite link everywhere** — premium signups through your link are worth 3x a partner conversion
- **Help members in tickets** — new members in welcome tickets are prime conversion opportunities
- **Position partner signups as free money** — deposit matches and bonus bets are genuinely good deals
- **Be the person who answers questions** — trust leads to conversions

## Questions?

If anything about the bonus system is unclear, DM Dax. The system will get more automated over time as the Promobot ticket features roll out, but the core mechanics (earn points, get your share) will stay the same.
