# Dropout Degens — Staff Onboarding Overview

Welcome to the Dropout Degens team. This document covers everything you need to know about your role, what we do, and how we operate.

---

## What Is Dropout Degens?

Dropout Degens is an education-first sports betting community on Discord. We're not a picks service — we teach members how to research, validate, and place bets using integrated tools and data. Our goal is to empower sports bettors with the resources and knowledge they need to find profitable opportunities on their own.

We make money two ways:
1. **Subscriptions:** Members pay for premium access to our tools, analysts, and community
2. **Partner conversions:** When members sign up for sportsbook apps using our referral codes, we earn a commission

Both of these revenue streams fund your compensation.

## Your Role as an Analyst

You are here to educate, engage, and convert. In that order.

### Educate
- Post picks with **reasoning** — explain the data, the tools, and the logic behind every play
- Help members understand how to evaluate bets themselves
- Reference the tools in our Discord (OddsJam, Novig, Props Cache, Outlier, EV data)
- Post daily recaps: for every day you send picks, post results before the next day's picks go out

### Engage
- Be active in at least 5 channels daily (general chat, members chat, betting floor channels, the lab)
- React on the daily poll, daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, and community picks channels
- Answer member questions — especially from newer bettors who are still learning
- Build genuine relationships with the community. Be casual, be authentic, talk sports.

### Convert
- Help members discover and sign up for our partner apps
- You need a **minimum of 5 partner conversions per month** to be eligible for compensation
- When a member signs up using a DD code, take a screenshot and submit proof in the #partner-attribution channel (tag the member + name the partner)
- Position partner signups as "free money" — deposit matches, bonus bets, sign-up promos. These are genuinely good deals for members.

## Screenshots

Post screenshots of your bets and apps whenever possible. This is one of the easiest and most effective things you can do.

- **Show the apps** — every time a member sees an app they haven't tried, it's a potential conversion
- **Dollar amounts are optional** — show whatever you're comfortable with
- **DFS apps especially** — Underdog, PrizePicks, and other DFS partners are accessible to most members
- Post screenshots in your analyst channel AND in the relevant sport channels (e.g., NBA pick screenshot goes in the NBA channel too)

## Your Tracked Invite Link

You'll receive a unique invite link to share. Every member who joins through your link is tracked. If that member later goes premium (even through a free trial), you earn **3 conversion points**.

Use your link everywhere: personal networks, friends, social media, other communities. More members through your link = more points = more compensation.

---

## Bet Tracking

You'll receive a standardized Google Sheets spreadsheet from Dax. Your responsibility is to keep it up to date:

- **Add every pick immediately when you post it** — don't wait for results
- **Mark results** (Win/Loss/Push) as soon as games finish
- **Required fields:** Date, league, bet type, odds, unit size, result, units won/lost
- Dax will also send you a ChatGPT link that can auto-format your bets into the spreadsheet

This data is used for your track record, member transparency, and feeds into our AI analytics tools.

---

## Compensation

### Base Pay
- **2% of monthly revenue** (subscription + partnership)
- Requires **minimum 5 conversions per month** to be eligible
- If you don't hit 5 conversions, you receive no base pay for that month

### 5% Staff Bonus Pool
- 5% of monthly revenue goes into a bonus pool
- Distributed proportionally based on **conversion points** earned that month
- See the separate **Staff Bonus Guide** for full details on how points work

### Payment Timing
- Monthly — Dax tallies everything at the end of the month
- Payouts happen after the tally is complete

---

## Tools & Access You'll Receive

- **Discord staff role** and relevant channel access
- **Tracked invite link** (generated by our bot via Supabase)
- **Bet tracking spreadsheet** (Google Sheets, pre-formatted)
- **ChatGPT formatter link** (for auto-formatting bet data)
- **Partner promo bot access** (shows which partners are available by state)
- **Calculator bots** (parlay calculator, bankroll management — in development)
- **Routine workspace access** (company knowledge base — view-only, coming soon)

---

## What Success Looks Like

- You're present in the server daily, even on days you don't post picks
- Your picks include reasoning and tool references — members learn from your posts
- You hit your 5-conversion minimum every month
- Your bet tracking spreadsheet is current with no gaps
- Members feel welcome and supported — especially newer bettors
- You communicate proactively — if you'll be inactive for a few days, let Dax know

---

## What to Avoid

- Going dark for multiple days without telling anyone
- Posting picks with no reasoning ("just take the over")
- Falling behind on bet tracking
- Zero conversions in a month
- Forcing bad picks just to post something — quality over quantity
- Treating DD like a picks service instead of an education community

---

## Questions?

DM Dax directly with any questions. Keep an eye on the analyst group chat for updates, and don't hesitate to ask if something isn't clear.
