# 5% Staff Bonus Pool & Conversion Points System

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026
**Owner:** Dax (CEO)

---

## Overview

5% of total monthly revenue is allocated to a staff bonus pool. This pool is distributed proportionally based on conversion points earned by staff during that month. Points reset each month — they are not cumulative.

The purpose is to incentivize staff to actively drive partner conversions and member recruitment, which is where DD's real revenue comes from.

---

## Pool Calculation

**Pool Amount = Total Monthly Revenue x 5%**

| Monthly Revenue | Bonus Pool |
|-----------------|------------|
| $1,000 | $50 |
| $2,000 | $100 |
| $5,000 | $250 |
| $10,000 | $500 |

---

## Point Sources

### 1. Partner Conversion — 1 Point Each

- A member signs up on any of DD's ~40 partners using a DD affiliate code or link
- Each verified signup = 1 conversion point for the staff member who attributed it
- Partners include: DFS apps (Underdog, PrizePicks, etc.), social sportsbooks (Fliff, Chalkboard, etc.), real sportsbooks (where legal), offshore options (Bet105)
- The CPA revenue DD earns (~$50 per conversion) is separate business revenue — the point is what the staff member earns toward the bonus pool

### 2. Premium Member Recruitment — 3 Points Each

- A new member joins the server through a staff member's tracked invite link AND joins premium (even through the free trial)
- This counts as 3 points because it adds the person to DD's membership members table, which is a high-value conversion
- Only counts for NEW premium members — not returning or already-existing premium members
- The 7-day free trial via Stripe counts (they entered payment info and are in the system)

### 3. Double Points — Invite + Convert

- If a staff member BOTH invites someone (via their tracked invite link) AND converts that same person onto a partner, they receive points for both actions
- Example: Staff invites person through link (3 points when they go premium) + that person signs up for Underdog using DD's code (1 point) = 4 points total from one member
- This rewards staff who bring in members AND help convert them

## Proof & Attribution

### Current Process (Manual)

1. Staff member identifies that a member has signed up on a partner
2. Staff member takes a screenshot of the member's signup confirmation
3. Staff member tags the person in the **#partner-attribution** channel with:
   - The member's Discord user tag
   - The partner name
   - Screenshot proof
4. Dax reviews at end of month and marks verified conversions
5. Points are tallied manually

### Future Process (Automated via Promobot)

The Promobot is being expanded to automate this flow:
1. Member clicks "claimed" on a partner in the Promobot interface
2. Bot auto-creates an individual ticket in the free access channel
3. Member submits proof of signup in the ticket
4. A moderator command approves the proof and auto-applies 7 free days of premium
5. Attribution is tracked automatically through the bot and ticket system

**Status:** In development as of February 2026. Waiting on Zach (Bellcube) to implement. Marked as ASAP priority.

## Distribution Formula

Each staff member's payout is proportional to their share of total points earned across all staff that month.

**Formula:**
```
Staff Member Payout = (Their Points / Total Points Across All Staff) x Pool Amount
```

### Worked Example

**Scenario:** $1,000 monthly revenue, $50 bonus pool

| Staff Member | Partner Conversions | Premium Invites | Double Points | Total Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| JP | 3 (3 pts) | 0 (0 pts) | 0 | 3 |
| Mark | 2 (2 pts) | 1 (3 pts) | 1 invite+convert (already counted) | 5 |
| Kaiden | 1 (1 pt) | 0 (0 pts) | 0 | 1 |
| Nanu | 1 (1 pt) | 0 (0 pts) | 0 | 1 |
| **Total** | | | | **10** |

| Staff Member | Points | Share | Payout |
|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| JP | 3 | 30% | $15.00 |
| Mark | 5 | 50% | $25.00 |
| Kaiden | 1 | 10% | $5.00 |
| Nanu | 1 | 10% | $5.00 |
| **Total** | **10** | **100%** | **$50.00** |

## Eligibility Requirements

Not everyone who earns points automatically receives a payout. Minimum conversion thresholds apply:

| Role | Minimum Conversions for Bonus Pool Payout |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| Analyst | 5 per month (same threshold as base pay) |
| Moderator (JP) | Under review — may be 5, may be lower |
| Moderator (Nanu) | 1 per month |
| Developer (Zach) | Not part of the conversion points system |

If a staff member does not meet their minimum, their points are forfeited for that month and the pool is distributed among those who do qualify.

## Tracked Invite Links

### How They Work
- Each staff member receives a unique invite link generated by the Dropout Degens bot via Supabase
- The link is persistent — the same link is used ongoing, not regenerated monthly
- Every member who joins through a specific link is tracked in Supabase with the referrer's attribution
- If a tracked invite member later subscribes to premium, the inviting staff member gets 3 points

### What Is Tracked
- Which staff member's link the new member used
- When they joined
- Whether they later subscribed to premium
- Demographic data (jurisdiction from Promobot, age range if provided)

### Link Distribution
- Dax provides each staff member with their tracked link during onboarding
- Links are also posted in the staff channels for easy access

---

## Edge Cases

### Zero Total Points in a Month
- If no staff member earns any points, the 5% pool is not distributed
- At Dax's discretion: rolls into bonus funds or is held for the following month

### Single Staff Member Earns All Points
- That person receives the entire bonus pool (assuming they meet their minimum)

### Staff Member Joins Mid-Month
- Points earned from their start date count normally
- No proration of the pool itself — they compete for the full pool with whatever points they earn

### Disputed Attribution
- If two staff members claim the same conversion, Dax makes the call based on available proof
- General rule: the person who submitted proof first in #partner-attribution gets the point

### Partner Conversion Without DD Code
- If a member signs up for a partner but does NOT use a DD code/link, it does not count as a conversion for anyone
- No CPA revenue = no point to attribute

## Partners Database Reference

The full list of ~40 partners is maintained in the Routine workspace partners database. Each partner entry includes:
- Partner name and category (DFS, social sportsbook, real sportsbook, offshore)
- Affiliate code and link
- CPA value
- State/jurisdiction availability
- Age requirements
- Bonus offer details

Staff will receive access to the partners database once the Routine team sharing feature ships. Until then, the Promobot in Discord shows available partners by state.
