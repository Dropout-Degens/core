# Welcome Ticket Messaging

**Purpose:** Working document for how we communicate inside welcome tickets — the framing, the questions, and the flow. This is a living doc — update it as we test and iterate.

**Reference:** Built from the Layup / Owen Monaghan research sessions (Jan 22–23, 2026). Read those first if you want the full methodology context.

## What the Welcome Ticket Is For

Every new member gets a private welcome ticket. It's the first 1-on-1 touchpoint we have with them.

Two goals:
1. **Find their pain point** — understand where they are in their betting journey and what's not working for them
2. **Establish how DD helps** — connect their pain to what we actually offer, and orient them to the server

The ticket is not a sales pitch. It's a conversation. The member should feel like they're talking to someone who actually wants to understand their situation.

## The Core Framing Principle (From Owen / Mom Test)

The biggest mistake is asking people what they *want* instead of learning what they *do*.

> ❌ "Would you want a tool that helps you track your bets?"
> ✅ "When was the last time you tracked how much you spent on betting?"

The first question tells you nothing — everyone says yes to hypothetical tools. The second reveals whether tracking is actually a behavior they've tried or care about.

**The rule:** Ask about last instance, not hypothetical preference. Ask about their life, not your product.

Pain is revealed through stories. The goal is to hear something like:
> *"I had a huge win in February and just kept betting and lost it all back within a week."*

That's a profit taking pain point. Now you know exactly what to say next.

---

## Framing the Ask

Before dropping the questions, set the context. The framing Owen recommended:

> *"Fill out this form and we'll give you expert advice on how to optimize your betting profitability strategies."*

The word **profitability** is intentional — it's the language bettors actually search for (see: Poro finding OddsJam by Googling "how to be more profitable"). It's specific, it's credible, and it positions DD as the answer to a real question they're already asking.

This framing makes the questions feel helpful, not extractive. We're offering something in exchange for their answers — personalized advice, not a generic pitch.

## The 6 Questions (Areas, Not Final Wording)

These are the six behavior areas to explore. Exact question wording should be drafted using Mom Test framing — ask about last instance of the behavior, not whether they'd want a product.

| Area | What We're Learning | Example Framing Direction |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Profit Taking** | Do they actually withdraw wins or let it ride? | "When was the last time you took money out of a sportsbook after a big win?" |
| **Hedging** | Do they hedge? Emotionally or strategically? | "When was the last time you hedged a bet — placed a bet on the other side to lock in a win or cut a loss?" |
| **Tracking** | Do they track spending? Do they care? | "Have you ever tracked how much you've spent on betting? What made you start or stop?" |
| **Separate Bank Account** | Do they separate betting money from personal finances? | "Do you keep your betting bankroll separate from your regular bank account?" |
| **Unit Sizes / Bankroll** | Do they have a system? Does the lack of one hurt them? | "Do you bet in units, or do you decide how much to bet on a case-by-case basis?" |
| **Taxes** | Are they aware of their tax obligations? | "Do you track your betting activity for taxes, or have you thought about how winnings get reported?" |

**Note on hedging:** There are two types — practical (EV-based, disciplined) and emotional (anxiety-driven). Both are valid profiles. A person who hedged yesterday is highly engaged with strategy — that's a strong signal. Don't treat hedging as a bad behavior.

## What to Do With the Answers

After they answer, don't give a generic response. Connect what they said to what DD actually offers.

| If Their Pain Is... | Connect It To... |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Profit taking / losing wins back | Bankroll management education, discipline strategies, unit sizing |
| Emotional hedging | EV education, understanding when hedging helps vs. hurts |
| No tracking | Bet tracking resources, spreadsheets, OddsJam logging tools |
| No separate account | Unit system setup, Layup (as a separate tool — positioned carefully) |
| No unit system | DD's unit calculator, bankroll management basics |
| Unaware of taxes | Responsible gaming resources, professional bettor resources |

**The CTA after the form:** Offer to open a personalized advice thread.

> *"Based on what you shared, I want to point you to a few specific things in the server that'll actually be useful for where you're at. Want me to open a thread for you?"*

This is the moment where the ticket becomes a real conversation, not just a checklist.

## Orienting Them to DD (General Onboarding)

After or alongside the pain point discovery, make sure they understand what the server is and how it works. The goal isn't to overwhelm them — just orient them to the 3-4 things that matter most for a new member.

**Core orientation points:**

1. **We're education-first.** We don't just give you picks — we teach you how to find profitable bets. That's what makes us different.

2. **EV alerts.** We send positive expected value alerts through our OddsJam partnership. Explain what EV means in plain language. This is a key differentiator and it's free access for all members.

3. **Analysts.** We have a team of analysts covering all major sports. They publish picks in their own channels with reasoning — not just results.

4. **Partners.** We have 20+ partnerships with tools in the sports betting space. These aren't just promos — they're the tools that help you bet better. Link them to the partners channel.

5. **All Access trial.** Remind them their trial is active and what it unlocks. They should be actively exploring during the trial window.

## Tone Inside the Ticket

- Write like a person, not a bot
- Short messages, not walls of text
- Ask one question at a time if it's conversational — don't dump all 6 at once
- When they share something, respond to it before moving on
- If they say something surprising or specific, follow it — don't just run through the script

The ticket is a conversation. The questions are a framework, not a rigid form.

---

## What This Is NOT

- A subscription pitch ("you should upgrade to All Access")
- A partner code drop ("use code DD for 20% off")
- A generic "welcome to the server" message that could have been an announcement

The welcome ticket is the most high-leverage touchpoint we have with a new member. Use it.
