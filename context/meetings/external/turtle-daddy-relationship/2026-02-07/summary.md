- Payment processing: **Dub Club** (15% fee, was 20% initially) plus ~130 members paying via **Venmo** directly (no fees, no taxes on those)
- Revenue: ~$25,000 in the first 6 months of operation
- Pricing: Varies — $20/week during hot streaks, $20/month normally, some grandfathered at $5/week. No consistent pricing structure.
- Sports: Primarily **MLB** (his favorite — loves nerfy models, summer morning games from West Coast). Also NBA.
- Previously had an MLB props analyst who made ~100 units in 4 months — the analyst went into gambling rehab and disappeared
- Partnerships: Almost none. Has **Novig** (~7 signups in 1.5 months). 99% of his income is premium subscriptions.
- Staff: No paid staff. A few volunteer mods who ban bot accounts.
- Has scammer/bot issues with invite links being grabbed

**Personal:**
- Gamer: Fortnite, League of Legends, Rocket League (Grand Champ on PlayStation). Hit Immortal in Valorant in high school.
- Has a girlfriend who works weekdays
- Casual, authentic personality — very direct and personable

## What Dax Shared

Dax walked Turtle Daddy through DD's infrastructure and positioning:

- **OddsJam partnership:** 500,000+ EV notifications stored in the database, full permission to use and send in Discord. Partnership with Alex Monahan (recently sold a company for $160M).
- **EV algorithm:** Gets ~2,000 notifications per day (~3 every 5 minutes). Building a filter algorithm using 200,000+ parsed alerts. The 2025 hockey EV algorithm was up 30-40 units. Working on 2026 hockey and MLB algorithms.
- **Sports data API access:** Scraping data to cross-reference OddsJam EV predictions against actual outcomes (e.g., "when they say 70% chance, it actually hits 80% of the time").
- **Partnership infrastructure:** 40+ partners at ~$50 CPA each. Customer LTV of ~$1,500, projected $2,000-$2,500 after Dax turns 21.
- **Subscription:** Currently $15/month, raising to $50/month. Giving away free premium generously at current price.
- **Ticketing system:** Welcome tickets for every new join, expired sub tickets for re-engagement, free access automation.
- **Developer situation:** Zach is a talented full-stack dev but works 53 hours/week at a frying pan factory. Recently promoted to re-automate their factories. Development is stalled until Dax can get him on a call.
- **Revenue:** Under $1,000/month currently. Failed acquisition attempt last semester.
- **Education-first positioning:** Selling the value of tools and education, not just picks.
- **Revenue share model:** Staff on percentage-based compensation.
- **Stripe at 3%** — much cheaper than Dub Club's 15% or WAP's 30%.

Dax also showed Turtle Daddy the EV spreadsheets (2025 hockey, data collection), the Discord server structure, and the partner promo bot.

## Overlapping Members

They discovered shared members between their Discords:
- **Colson6207** — has All-Access on DD and is in Turtle Daddy's premium. Joined DD the day before this call.
- This suggests some organic crossover between the two communities.

## Platform Discussion

Dax mentioned he's considering creating accounts on Dub Club, WAP, and Winnable to promote DD and funnel members onto their Stripe plan. Turtle Daddy shared his experience:
- Dub Club: 15% fee (was 20%), takes care of Stripe processing
- WAP: 30% + 3% Stripe (terrible)
- Venmo direct: No fees, but manual management (~130 members)
- Turtle Daddy tells members to pay him directly after their first month for a $5 discount (technically violates Dub Club terms)

## Affiliate Industry Discussion

Dax warned Turtle Daddy about affiliate compliance issues:
- Paying people to sign up for partner codes (e.g., giving $20 to sign up for Novig) violates partnership agreements
- If the partner (Novig) found out, they'd be upset about users who might not return
- Referenced Hot Streak — a pyramid scheme company that was a middleman between affiliates and sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings), paying deposits for signups

Turtle Daddy acknowledged he didn't realize the Novig incentive was problematic.

## What Was Discussed for Collaboration

### Option 1: Staff Role / Engagement

Dax offered Turtle Daddy:
- A staff role in DD for engagement/contribution
- Open access to what DD is building — Turtle Daddy can pick what he wants to help with
- No obligation to be paid — Turtle Daddy said he doesn't need payment, just wants to grow together

Turtle Daddy was receptive: "I definitely spend a lot of time at this computer. If I'm not on TikTok Live or banned from TikTok Live, I do look for shit to do during the day."

### Option 2: Partnership Codes

Dax offered to help Turtle Daddy get additional partner codes/affiliates through DD's existing relationships — even if Turtle Daddy hasn't generated signups for them yet.

### Option 3: Community Merge / Acquisition

Dax floated the idea of a community merge:
- 15-20% stake offered to Turtle Daddy
- All of Turtle Daddy's members would get a free month of DD premium
- DD's ticketing system would capture them permanently
- Goal: validate DD's education-first positioning with real members

**Turtle Daddy's concerns:**
- His premium currently revenues more than DD — a merge would be negative value for him right now
- Doesn't want to stop his Dub Club payments and redirect members
- Worried his members might leave his premium for DD's if DD is better
- People in the space think everything is a scam — hard to get his members comfortable
- Wants to keep his own premium running independently

### What They Landed On

A softer approach for now:
- Turtle Daddy **refers people he knows** for a **free month of DD premium**
- Turtle Daddy backs it personally: "Hey, go get a month of this. It's super educational. Completely different than mine."
- They track whether those people continue after the free month
- If it works, they go from there
- Turtle Daddy also gets a staff role for engagement
- Dax helps Turtle Daddy get more partner codes
- Merge remains a **rolling offer** — revisit when DD is in a better revenue position

## How the Call Ended

- Dax had to run to a staff call (1:1 with one of his analysts)
- Turtle Daddy offered to join the staff call — Dax said it was a 1:1
- Both agreed to follow up — Dax will send organized documentation and continue the conversation
- Turtle Daddy: "I definitely wanna work together. I think it could definitely be beneficial for both of us."
- Tone was very positive and genuine throughout — natural rapport
