# Turtle Daddy — Next Steps — February 7, 2026

---

## Immediate (This Week)

## Short-Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

- Turtle Daddy begins engaging in DD with staff role
- First batch of free month referrals go out — track retention
- Dax sends Turtle Daddy new partner codes as they come through
- Both continue building rapport and understanding each other's operations
- Dax gets DD's systems in better shape (EV tool, ticketing, pricing pivot to $50)

---

## Medium-Term (1-3 Months)

- Evaluate free month referral results — did people stay? Did they convert on partners?
- DD's revenue position should improve with $50/month pricing, EV tool launch, and re-engagement campaign
- If DD revenues improve meaningfully, revisit the merge conversation with updated numbers
- If Turtle Daddy's TikTok growth continues, his audience could be a significant acquisition channel for DD
- MLB season starts (late March) — Turtle Daddy's strongest sport. Natural time to deepen collaboration if it's going well.

## Open Questions

1. **What does the staff role look like in practice?** — Dax offered open-ended engagement. Needs to be defined once Turtle Daddy starts participating.
2. **Which partners should Turtle Daddy get codes for?** — Needs to match his California audience (DFS, social sportsbooks, offshore).
3. **How will free month referrals be tracked?** — Tracked invite link? Promo code? Manual?
4. **Is MLB coverage a formal offering?** — DD has no MLB analyst. If Turtle Daddy contributes MLB picks, that fills a real gap.
5. **What happens if referral retention is strong?** — Does this escalate to a formal partnership with rev share? A merge? Something else?

## Relationship Assessment

**Tone:** Very positive. Natural rapport. Both were genuine and direct. Turtle Daddy was receptive to helping without payment. Dax was transparent about DD's current state (low revenue, rebuilding).

**Risk:** Low. Turtle Daddy is not aggressive — he's cautious about merging and protective of his own thing. He won't do anything that hurts his own operation. The soft collaboration approach (staff role + referrals + partner codes) has minimal downside for either party.

**Upside:** If the relationship develops, Turtle Daddy brings:
- MLB expertise (DD's biggest sport gap heading into summer)
- TikTok Live acquisition channel (25 new paid subs in a day when unbanned)
- Data analytics / finance background (useful for modeling, tracking)
- ~700 Discord members as potential DD converts
- Authentic personality that fits DD's community vibe

**Next call:** Not formally scheduled. Dax to follow up with documentation and continue the conversation async.
