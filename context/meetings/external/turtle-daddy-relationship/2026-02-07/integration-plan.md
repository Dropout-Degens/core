# Turtle Daddy — Integration Plan — February 7, 2026

---

## Current Integration (Soft / Informal)

No formal integration was agreed upon. The following is the soft collaboration plan that emerged:

### Phase 1: Immediate (Now)

1. **Staff role in DD** — Dax grants Turtle Daddy a staff role for engagement and access
2. **Partner codes** — Dax reaches out to DD's existing partners to get Turtle Daddy affiliate codes for his own Discord
3. **Free month referrals** — Turtle Daddy personally refers people he knows to try DD premium for free. He endorses it: "Go get a month of this. It's super educational. Completely different than mine."
4. **Tracking** — DD tracks whether referred members continue past the free month

### Phase 2: Evaluation

- After the free month referrals play out, both sides assess:
  - Did referred members stay?
  - Did they convert on DD partners?
  - Was the experience positive for both communities?
- Based on results, discuss whether to deepen the collaboration

### Phase 3: Potential Merge (Future / Conditional)

If DD reaches a stronger revenue position and both parties are interested:
- Turtle Daddy's members would get free DD premium for one month
- DD's ticketing system captures all members permanently
- Turtle Daddy would receive a 15-20% stake
- Turtle Daddy retains a high role in DD
- Would need to address: Turtle Daddy's Dub Club members, pricing differences, his independent premium

## Technical Setup Needed

### For the Staff Role
- [ ] Create staff role for Turtle Daddy in DD Discord
- [ ] Grant appropriate channel access
- [ ] Set up tracked invite link for Turtle Daddy (Supabase)

### For Partner Code Assistance
- [ ] Dax identifies which partners would be relevant for Turtle Daddy's audience
- [ ] Dax reaches out to partners on Turtle Daddy's behalf
- [ ] Turtle Daddy receives codes and integrates into his Discord

### For Free Month Referrals
- [ ] Dax provides Turtle Daddy with a referral mechanism (tracked link or promo code for free month)
- [ ] DD tracks referral source and retention after free month expires
- [ ] Expired sub ticket system captures churning members for re-engagement

## What DD Showed (Infrastructure Turtle Daddy Now Knows About)

Dax gave Turtle Daddy visibility into:
- **OddsJam EV data** — 500K+ notifications, spreadsheets, algorithm development
- **EV algorithm** — 2,000 alerts/day, filtering methodology, hockey performance (30-40 units)
- **Partner promo bot** — state-based partner availability
- **Ticketing system** — welcome tickets, expired sub re-engagement
- **Revenue model** — partnership CPA ($50), education-first positioning
- **Stripe processing** — 3% vs Dub Club's 15%
- **Developer situation** — stalled but talented

This is relevant because if a merge happens later, Turtle Daddy already understands DD's systems and value proposition.

## Overlapping Members

Discovered during the call:
- **Colson6207** — All-Access in DD, also in Turtle Daddy's premium. Joined DD the day before this call.
- Indicates organic crossover between the two communities
- Worth monitoring whether more overlap exists

## Barriers to Full Integration

1. **Revenue gap** — Turtle Daddy's operation revenues ~$4K+/month. DD is under $1K. He won't merge into a smaller operation.
2. **Independent premium** — Turtle Daddy wants to keep his Dub Club/Venmo premium running. Can't redirect those members.
3. **Trust** — People in the space are suspicious of any collaboration. Turtle Daddy's members may resist moving to another Discord.
4. **OddsJam restriction** — DD's OddsJam EV data can only be sent within DD's own server, not shared into external servers. This is a key reason a merge would need members to come to DD.
5. **TikTok dependence** — Turtle Daddy's entire acquisition channel is TikTok Live. If he's banned (currently on a 3-day ban), he has no new income. This makes his operation fragile but his live audience valuable.
6. **No MLB analyst on DD** — DD doesn't currently have MLB coverage. Turtle Daddy filling this gap would be significant value if he joined more formally.
