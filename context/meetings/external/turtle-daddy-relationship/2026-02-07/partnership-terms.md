# Turtle Daddy — Partnership Terms — February 7, 2026

---

## Current Agreement

No formal agreement was reached. This was an introductory call. The following was discussed and loosely agreed upon:

### What Dax Offers Turtle Daddy
1. **Staff role in DD** — engagement-based, no specific KPIs. Turtle Daddy picks what he wants to help with.
2. **Partner codes** — Dax will leverage DD's existing partner relationships to help Turtle Daddy get affiliate codes for his own Discord, even without prior signups.
3. **Free month of DD premium** for people Turtle Daddy refers — Turtle Daddy personally vouches and sends them over.
4. **Open access** to DD's systems, tools, and strategy — Turtle Daddy can see what's being built and contribute where interested.

### What Turtle Daddy Offers DD
1. **Engagement and presence** — helps with activity in DD's Discord when he has downtime (especially when banned from TikTok Live)
2. **Referrals** — sends people he knows to try DD premium for free. Backs it with personal endorsement.
3. **Sports betting expertise** — MLB specialist, data analytics background, experienced capper
4. **Future merge potential** — open to revisiting a community merge when DD is in a stronger revenue position

### What Was NOT Agreed To
- **No community merge at this time** — Turtle Daddy's premium revenues more than DD currently. He will not redirect his Dub Club members.
- **No payment** — Turtle Daddy explicitly said Dax doesn't need to pay him. He sees mutual growth as the value.
- **No exclusivity** — Turtle Daddy keeps his own Discord and premium running independently.

## Merge Offer (Rolling / Future)

Dax floated a merge structure that remains an open offer:

- **Stake:** 15-20% offered to Turtle Daddy
- **Structure:** Turtle Daddy's members would get a free month of DD premium. DD's ticketing system captures them. Goal is to convert and retain through education and partnership value.
- **Turtle Daddy's position:** Not interested right now. His operation revenues ~$4,000+/month (extrapolated from $25K in 6 months). DD is under $1,000/month. The math doesn't work for him to merge into DD currently.
- **Revisit:** When DD's revenue and systems are in a stronger place. Dax acknowledged DD isn't ready yet.

## Revenue Comparison (Context for Terms)

| Metric | Dropout Degens | Turtle Daddy |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Monthly revenue | ~$1,000 | ~$4,000+ (est.) |
| Members | ~8,000 (fewer than 100 active) | ~700 (~2,500 followers) |
| Premium subscribers | Sub-50 | ~130+ (Venmo) + Dub Club |
| Subscription price | $15/month (raising to $50) | $20/week or $20/month |
| Partnerships | 40+ at ~$50 CPA | Novig only (~7 signups) |
| Staff | 4 analysts, 2 mods, 1 dev | Solo (volunteer mods only) |
| Marketing spend | ~$200 (one organic post) | $0 (TikTok Live organic) |

Key insight: Turtle Daddy has stronger immediate revenue from premium sales. DD has stronger infrastructure (partnerships, tools, ticketing, EV data) but weaker revenue and engagement. A partnership would be complementary if DD can demonstrate value.

## Compensation

No compensation discussed or agreed upon for either party. Turtle Daddy was clear: "You don't even need to pay me necessarily. I think I would definitely be down to help you."

If a formal arrangement develops later, it would likely follow DD's standard rev share model (2% analyst base + 5% bonus pool). But nothing was proposed on this call.

## Compliance Notes

Dax flagged a compliance issue during the call:
- Turtle Daddy mentioned giving people $20 to sign up for Novig
- Dax warned this violates partnership/affiliate agreements — the partner (Novig) would care if they found out
- Turtle Daddy also mentioned telling Dub Club members to pay him via Venmo directly for a discount, which violates his Dub Club agreement
- These are not DD's issues, but worth noting for context on Turtle Daddy's operational practices
