---

## Who Is Arsam

Arsam is 18 years old (turned 18 about four months ago), based in California. He works at AT&T in sales and attends college. He runs a sports betting Discord called **BigBetLounge** with his friend/partner **Heiko**. He was previously a member of the Dropout Degens Discord when he was younger.

Arsam describes himself as a strong salesman from his AT&T experience — comfortable with closing VIP deals, DM outreach, and price negotiation. He positions his value as both a skilled bettor and an effective seller.

## Arsam's Betting Background

- Started betting 1.5 years ago, initially casually, then got serious
- **Tennis** is his primary sport — claims ~70% of all profits come from tennis
- Specializes in **live betting** on tennis: watches matches at 2-4 AM, identifies momentum shifts, catches underdogs before odds flip
- Treats tennis betting like trading — finding the right entry points on underdogs who become favorites within a serve or game
- Also bets NBA and some UFC
- His partner Heiko has hit multiple $10,000 parlays on WNBA
- Regular unit size was $500, daily play around $1,500
- Claims daily profit of $500-$1,000 on good days
- Overall win rate: claims 65-70%, with 30% losses
- BigBetLounge had ~100 members, 9 paying VIP members
- VIP members would stay up together at 3 AM betting live tennis picks in the chat

## What Arsam Wants

Arsam's stated goals coming into the call:
1. **Primary:** Combine his and Heiko's expertise (tennis, NBA, sales) with DD's infrastructure, partnerships, and member base
2. **Secondary:** Potentially buy out Dropout Degens if Dax isn't interested in continuing

He believes tennis is a gap in DD's current offering and that his sales skills could significantly boost VIP conversions and partner signups. He repeatedly emphasized the value of picks that consistently hit as the core driver of revenue.

## What Dax Showed

Dax walked Arsam through DD's current state and strategy:
- **40 partners** with ~$50 CPA per conversion
- **Customer LTV** of ~$1,500 across all partnerships
- **Education-first positioning** — teaching members to be educated bettors, not just following picks blindly
- **EV algorithm** built on OddsJam and Daily Grind Fantasy data — 2,000+ alerts per day, filtered to ~10 per day, ~60-70% hit rate, up 30-40 units
- **Promobot** showing partner availability by state, with planned ticket automation for conversions
- **Discord bots** — parlay calculator, bankroll management tool with personalized unit sizing
- **Welcome ticket funnel** — auto-ticket for every new join, 7 free days for partner signup, expired sub re-engagement tickets
- **Tracked invite links** per staff member via Supabase
- **Conversion points system** for staff compensation
- **Server stats:** ~8,000 members, ~1,000-1,500 monthly active, fewer than 100 actually active
- **Current revenue:** ~$1,000/month (stagnant for ~6 months)
- **Projected revenue:** $5,000-$10,000/month within a couple months with re-engagement and marketing

## The Buyout Offer

Arsam offered **$10,000** to buy Dropout Degens outright. His terms:
- He and Heiko would take ownership and manage the server
- Dax would retain a high role, his own channel, and earn a percentage
- DD's existing partnerships would remain, with Arsam focusing more on VIP sales
- Arsam justified the $10K by citing DD's current inactivity (fewer than 100 active members)

**Dax declined.** His reasoning:
- DD was valued at ~$35,000 in November 2025 at ~$2,000/month revenue
- At even $500/month average, Dax would want 4-5x that value
- 20 conversions alone would generate $1,000 in partnership revenue — achievable with current staff
- He's willing to revisit in 1-2 months after evaluating growth

## How the Call Ended

- No deal was made
- Arsam said he'd talk to Heiko and come back with a decision on whether to pursue an analyst role, partnership, or revisit the buyout later
- Dax said he'd be open to a conversion-based analyst arrangement if Arsam is interested
- Both agreed to reconnect in a couple months
- Arsam was respectful and left the door open for future collaboration
