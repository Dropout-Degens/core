ARS ours And, you know... Shorter, it's easier.

ours yeah awesome nice to meet you man yeah it's so nice to meet you brother so look um why don't you tell me a little bit about just your discord and what like you've been running and also like tell me about your profit yeah i'd love to hear that and uh i got you i'll tell you what's going on with us Yeah, so Me and my friend, his name's Heiko, well me and him started betting at, One and a half year ago, I wasn't that serious to be honest.

I was just betting for fun at first. Then the more I got into it, the more I realized that I'm getting really good at it because I know sports. And obviously, the more you bet, the more you kind of know sports, the more you engage and even watch sports for a living kind of. So I started watching a lot of tennis. I never liked tennis, to be honest. That was a boring sport until I started betting on it.

I realized that most of my profits, including everything I've made, I think probably like 70% flip that I've made, have been through tennis because it's the easiest sport to you know kind of find the right moments to go in out i treat as trading kinda there's a right time when you can bet and catch an underdog they become a favorite in seconds it's one serve game you know i'll explain it later but i'm sure you know tennis So yeah, it's literally easy sport to bet on.

That's one of the sports that I've made my most money off of. There's basketball, NBA, obviously. WNBA, my friend, he's hit multiple $10,000 parlays. And not in a sense where he just got lucky. It's us sitting and analyzing it. We've hit multiple regular safe from $500,000 to $1,500,000. Mine and his units, regular units, were $500. So he would put, he daily would play around, you know, play around $1,500, go up, down, you know, regardless of what it is.

Yeah, we would profit around, you know, $500 to $1,000 a day. Some days it would be more. Obviously, there's some losses, but as long as you hit anything above 6 and a 10 bets, you're profiting. And that's what was happening. We realized that we're really good at it. We realized that we're finessing kind of tennis because we used to literally sit on this court, wait for the games to start all like at 2 a.m., right?

Because tennis games sometimes are like late. So we would watch the game at 3, 4 a.m., analyze who's playing a little worse, who's playing a little better, getting tired. And there's some little details that I'll explain later. We look at how they play. We look at how the odds reflect. And we make a decision if we want to go in, if we don't want to do it, if we want to sweat it. Most of the bets we've made have been live bets.

I think that's the most money we've made off. Because tennis specifically, you have to bet live. Yeah, the second we realized we're really good at it and we're really good at analyzing sports and being true, we just started this course. I think it's been three months, but yeah, we got a little not lazy. We had some stuff going on. I had work that I had to focus on, including school, which we stopped doing anything for like a month.

And now we're restarting it again. It's been like a week, two weeks that we've been actually consistently posting, consistently trying to post videos and etc. But yeah, obviously, once you're starting off, you know how it is. viral or you know you make you posting on Twitter and TikTok Instagram everything it's very slow you Yeah, but the bets we've hit, the people that join, they do make profit off of us.

You know, we hit most of the time. I have green slips I can share with you. which is our verified wins. would have made obviously uh i don't have my losses on this yet because uh we haven't really, you know, had the amount of people for us to post losses for now because obviously you want to look good at first and then, you know, obviously your hospitality, you want to just be clear with people. You want to be straightforward that this is the losses, this is the wins.

But yeah, most of the time, It's been W's. I think we've hit probably 65 to 70% overall profit specifically. 30% been losses where it's unfortunate. Maybe we fucked up. Maybe we just messed up a part somewhere. We added another pick that we shouldn't have. We risked it. Let me screen share, show you some of the wins. I'm going to take a look at it. So, BigBetLounge, this is our Discord. We don't have a lot of tabs, we just try keeping it neat.

Can I ask you a couple questions?

Yes, sir, of course. There's an echo going on, let me... Is it for me?

It's for me. Just needed it it's through the stream Yeah, yeah That's weird. No worries. Basically, I have a couple questions. How old are you again?

I'm 18, brother.

You're 18, so you just turned 18.

Like four months ago, yes sir.

Okay, okay, so you were my server when you were like way young, okay. Yeah, yeah. What state are you in right now?

California. That sucks. Which is like, you know, yeah, it does suck. You in school there? Uh, College.

Do you live in California as well, or...?

Yes, I do. I'm in LA, bro. You're in LA.

Okay, okay.

Yeah, which is, look, so it does get a little thing when... Because Fliff was one of the few apps that was kind of letting us, you know... I bet, obviously, but other apps were kind of banned, obviously. Now, since the new law came out, we're a little bit more careful, but Flip is finding ways around it because see how it says Moneyline, for example, right? Indiana Pacers Moneyline. Now they changed it to head-to-head fantasy points, which means you're betting on who gets more points, which means it's kind of around the law that says you can't bet on money lines, but we're not betting on money lines.

We're betting on who gets more points, which is still the same thing.

One thing is I have a social sports book. So I'm really up to date. And to give you a little bit, I'll give you a little bit of context on drive-out DJs now, and then I'll let you go back to it. I'm just scrolling through the pics right now.

I have four monitors, to be realistic, but I haven't opened up my second one right now.

But with Dropout Degens, so I'm also in college right now. I'm at Syracuse in New York, which also sucks because we got everything banned as well. But I'm about to send you a social sports book right now. But kind of like what I was going to touch on earlier was we are focused on our partnerships. So we have 40 partners right now, which is a crazy number. and our customer LTV is insane because of that and so here's another I've realized yeah sorry to interrupt but I've realized that it's legal in California so you might like this But...

Basically, and I'm also, so for a little bit of context of why Dropout Degens hasn't been active, I tried to acquire two servers about, to about a year ago now. And so I also got my internship around then. And so this was around the time we had expanded to 20 partners. And so really I had done these server acquisitions and I also got my internship. So I had to, and I was also at school. So I had to step back a little bit on how active I was.

And so I didn't really do a good job managing the staff. And I also didn't do a good job of onboarding new staff Yeah, yeah. But right now, let me show you something as well.

Basically, we've been collecting data from Odds Jam and Daily Grind Fantasy for about two years now. And so we have a ton of data. And this is our 2025 hockey EV. And we're working on getting this live. We're getting it as ASAP. This is our number one priority.

But you can take a look through our spreadsheet here. So we're going to be pushing our positioning to, like, I guess a lot of...

AI, kind of.

Uh, what's that with AI? So this data that you said the chat that you sent it's kinda you guys collecting data and then the a oh wait, oh I was looking at the How key be the top ones you've seen how the bots and odds and the odds to hit that that was the thing So basically we have a bot we build out an algorithm on top of another algorithm that is yeah fantasy and odd sham So we get two thousand but today and we just say these are the ten good ones a day that we're gonna send out and so it went I think we were like 60 something percent like maybe 70 70 but we're up like 30 units on a one unit wager per per bet so um it might have been like 40 or 50 um but it's yeah so we're focusing on that um and so like we're gonna start rebranding and raising our prices soon um and then i'm also talking to another couple of people um i have three server acquisitions that i'm looking at right now um but i'm kind of holding off We've got a bunch of development features that are in progress right now, so I want to get those pushed to prod and live before we acquire the server, their servers.

So I guess to... kind of like Can you give me a little more context on your server?

Yeah, so... Our server, my goal of texting you was not kind of too You could say kind of combining Discords, but I don't want to take whatever you've made obviously because it's way different than what we do. By way different I mean you've been in the game, you've developed your own server, you've done the work. And the main reason we have the Discord, reason why we have this is because we are really focused on getting the sales.

I've been working for AT&T, right? So that's my actual job, which implies that I'm pretty good at selling because I'm a sales expert. So my main job is to sell things, sell phones, internet, everything. So I play with the prices. I play with lowering the bill to add something extra, data or like a tablet or like a watch on people's bills. which means I'm really good at the number game. It means if I need to sell something to people, which means I need to close out a VIP deal or I need to...

DM someone about getting the VIP. I'm really good at, you know, wording myself right. Coming from, you know, starting high and then lowering the price so they could maybe, you know, kind of play with the price a little bit, you know? So that was the main thing that I was really good at betting and I'm really good at selling. Both of us are good at selling, but I obviously work at things, so it's a little more experience for me.

So I just want to combine both of that, my knowledge about tennis, NBA, and UFC. Tennis is the main thing. You focused on hockey, like you said. I think having tennis is going to, I think, change the game because tennis is the only sport, in my opinion, that... You literally can green on the underdogs every day. I think that's the only sport that has insane underdogs and those underdogs consistently win.

You know, like one tournament, let's say the underdog enters the tournament and he's playing, he's playing on an insane level and it's like a, you know, wild card. That wild card can go so far until the final and he's going to be underdog until the final, which means every time you bet on him, every round has been cashed. So the second you catch that guy, that breakout, And there's one guy for sure in every tournament.

Like there's a 16 year old yesterday, I think, a tennis player is top 545, I think, or something. He played a top 80 player and he obviously was an underdog. He beat him and he beat the guy after him, which means he was underdog twice. We caught him twice. twice and you know it's it's gonna cash every time because you just know the game so good so i think tennis is what you're missing in the discord i think tennis specifically and nba nba you'd obviously do but uh i think i can add some of my experience and knowledge from basketball because i've played ball i've watched ball you know most of the most of my plays were basketball before i started tennis and we still do basketball so yeah Sure.

you know, We can work something out specifically about adding a few different sports. Maybe me managing a certain area of the Discord. And I think me selling the VIP way more than what it is because I know you focused on, like you said, the partnerships. I've done the numbers game for other discords. I know a guy that has... Like, I personally know him. He has... 80,000 members, right? Yeah. And his VIP is 45 a week.

I'll give you the math. I think, let's say, 1,500 of those people have VIP, right? He has 80,000 members in his Discord. I think it's top 10, one of the most famous VIPs betting discord specifically i forgot the name but i literally know him personally so 80 000 members let's say 1500 of them buy the vip 45 a week That's $67,500 a week, which means there's obviously the tax that WAP, for example, has, but...

That is pure profit, which means you don't reinvest, you're selling the value. So as long as the Discord shows the value of what you're selling, which do you do, which they know that we hit daily, which they know we hit, you know, sometimes. seven out of ten times and we have different type of sports and we are one of few most active discords you know, Out there. they're gonna buy the product. No matter what the pricing is, 45 a week is gonna be nothing.

If they can make it back with one bet, put 45 and double their money, that's it. That's the weekly membership. Everything else from that is to profit for them. And if it's them, all we got to do is explain it to them and not to put in a perspective where, oh, you're buying the product, you're buying the value, you're buying the service. You're not paying to just you know just the risk it to you.

Yeah So we're gonna raise our pricing to $50 a month and we're gonna charge $50 a month but really basically We can convert basically on all of our partners in one day. And so what we're going to do is just give free premium after a conversion on partners. So I like what you're saying, if it was like converting onto our partners, but like basically we don't care about premium sales because premium sales will come through the value.

And I didn't really get to explain this as much, but we've, we're, we're kind of repositioning in the space. Like, and a lot of what you talked about is kind of the marketing we're trying to get away from. So like, When it comes to the space, like, basically, that's what you're saying. That's what every Discord does. And we're not trying to really do that. Like, yes, we're selling a premium and everything.

But basically, like, every Discord just promotes on the value that our picks hit.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Of course. percent of our partners so the way that they can that our members can utilize and actually take advantage of the discord um and we still have to update a little bit of our material and again our ev actually isn't yet live we're still working on the algorithm for it to push this um but the whole aspect is they can use our outlier insights they can use our analyst picks they can use our odd sham ev um but the aspect is actually like where are they placing it and are they using knowledge behind that and that It's kind of just the either they have the knowledge through us or they have the knowledge through the tools in our discord.

And eventually like odd sham is a really expensive tool. It's 200 bucks per month. So eventually when that person can sustain the bankroll of both are $50 per month subscription, because one, they'll be having the value of the odd sham integrated tools and everything that you just mentioned that the picks are winning, but like, that's not a focus like that. That's just a plus. If that makes sense. Yeah.

Yeah. One question. So,Okay. Wow. How exactly do you get the sponsors in a way where... So if you're not focused on the picks, are you focused on... They say Sleeper, right? One of your sponsors, Sleeper, for example. Right? Was there a point where you DMed them in a way or was it like... How do you get sponsors to follow if your picks aren't as valuable?

So I valuable I mean, yeah, so we actually haven't had that many conversions on any of our partners Not that I'm saying like that. We haven't we've probably done about Half of our revenue and we've done about like probably a bit under 50k as a server but basically like We've done almost half that revenue through the partnerships, but that's actually realistically when you spread it across them, it's not that many per.

And I personally just have kept really good relationships with about 95% of our partners. They don't mind because we've kept them updated with, hey, this is the positioning that we're going towards and we're going to try to differentiate through you. So you guys do offer value and as partners, they do understand that they offer value and we're going to be promoting that value and it's up to our users to ultimately make the end decision, but also ultimately use our referral code.

Got it. Yeah, that makes sense actually. That does make sense. and Got it. I was gonna say it's... I'm just gonna say I've been a, you know, I'm gonna say it because it's not like I don't care about like ego and all of that. It's I've been a really big, you know, followers of follower of your discord. And Obviously, I've told you guys a lot. I've learned a lot from the basketball and I know you guys are all about, you know, obviously learning, you know, education specifically.

But do you think you would make more? Because money is the reason why we do all of this, obviously, because it's making money. Do you think... you would make more money off of your sponsorships or would you make more money off of your VIP if you were to lock in on one, either of them? Because sponsorships give you places, but then once you have a set you know, pricing where people Not only you have the sponsorships, but you also have the, you know, you have both.

You don't understand how we can push both. So let me bring it down. So basically, they're... The... The framing that we're trying to be, and I don't want to say this because I don't want to sell this, but the framing we basically are is we're teaching– it's a sports betters course and community. We're teaching you how to be an educated better. So I guess you– I don't know how much of the information we've had in the past that you might have been around for, but we've really focused on the bankroll management, but we didn't know how to advertise that.

hard portrayed to the community. But we're kind of switching that to a bit. And what that kind of entails, and I kind of lost my train of thought with my original thing, but basically with what that is, is like... People will get the value. You said it. Yeah. And like. I can show you all of our analysts right now. And also like you saw the spreadsheet, everything in the server is basically tracked like that.

So, we're going to and i i kind of messed or not messed up i haven't kept up with tracking it from like basically june of last june of 2025 to december of 2025 but i've started 2026 off very strong but basically like the way i would look at it is like right it's all about building the team in the community and people at this day and age like people are either going to be in so many betting discords that they're going to pay for the community and that's ultimately what going to have um and so it is about that subscription revenue and we're gonna charge that 50 a month um for but we're not really going to raise it more than that because basically we have 40 partners that we can if we convert them onto all 40 partners okay let's talk about like if we convert every single user onto all 40 partners then let's talk about raising the pricing but like for every user before we raise the pricing there is the opportunity to convert them onto one more And like, I'll set you the floor that like each partner is about $50 in value in the CPA.

So like, basically, So if they follow and they put your code in and they do everything that the partners obviously you know, tell you to do, which is put the promo, you're getting this for these odds or this specific stat for this much. If they follow and they use the code dropouts, you get a $50 discount this profit from each member. Yep. Got it. So which makes, obviously, makes up for the VIP.

Exactly. And so our VIP is basically, if we get them onto an... My goal is to get each user onto about five of our partners a month. And so what we bring value with is so we don't discriminate that much with our partnerships. And actually, we've tailored to the 18 plus crowd, which kind of is where you in, which it sucks that you there come. Come. Let's let's. Yeah. And we'll take you to a legal state so you could go through all of our partners.

But like we we focus on the 18 plus market because of the diversity there is there. Look at the social sports books and tell me how many of those have you seen. And I'm actually going to add two more of those that you've never, three more of those that you've never even seen before. And sadly, the only, there's only one of them that might be legal in California. But like, essentially, I can also help you get on sites that are, like, technically they're offshore and not as regulated, but they are not sketchy.

They are our partners and they are like a very valid site that it would be comfortable for you to bet on. Some Okay, I wouldn't say– I don't know much about limiting because that's more of the 21 plus, but all of our partners are very– and I won't say anything about FLIF, the social sports books because whatever, they're finicky. Yeah. Bet 105, for example, is basically they– in our book, so they accept any action.

And so they're super happy to be– like they'll take an $1,000 bet very happily. So like they don't– and they won't limit you, won't restrict you. So like– and they're legal in all 50 states because they're offshore. So like, yeah, kind of basically What we're going to be able to do is just like... And what I'm really doing right now is I'm expanding, like, the... I'm getting a good enough team behind me because, like, my time is a lot more valuable.

Like, I can send good picks. Like, I mean, like, I had three picks today that would have hit and I didn't send them. Like, I just... Because I genuinely, like... I woke up at...

Life, obviously.

Yeah, like... You have life. Let me show you my calendar. Like, it's actually, like, crazy. But, like... And for Dropout Degens, we're actually working on a ton. So like I'm in school right now. So I'm in school. This is Monday, Wednesday, Friday. And then I also have like my work meetings. So I work for a fintech startup in the sports betting space, which is also insanely expensive. I love it. It's really fun.

And I get a lot of sports betting perks. Not necessarily sports betting perks, but I have a lot of industry knowledge because of it. And so really... The way I would say and then I can show you one more thing is a lot of what we're building a lot of things And we're kind of stalled development mentally because my one developer he's he just graduated high school and got a full-time job making frying pans so like Like well now he's like doing development stuff for them, which I'm really proud of but like he was big in fry He's making like a, like...

Like it's yeah like three kids like I'm not gonna be able to fucking replicate that but like nine to five I wasn't making enough to be able to pay and so we're a lot of development to be stalled But we have a lot of features that are coming soon Like so we're building a lot of these bots So let me just odd shims calculators are what we're building them off of but basically we have a parlay calculator So you can put in your parlay could be one leg as many legs you want but the odds calculate it and one thing that we started doing is we have the bank robot um so we help you actually decide what your unit size is going to be like it's basically one three or five percent um but it's just in the betting tips um but basically you just hit this uh if i'm aggressive i think that's five percent so $100 bankrolls, $5 unit.

But basically... What I'm going to be doing or what we're going to be doing is anytime they use the calculator, it's going to convert to their unit size. So we're doing a lot of personalization features.

Yeah, I think that's great. Sorry for interrupt, but I think that's actually great because the more you, the more that brings value to people. brings value to people and the more people join up and the more attention the Discord gets, the more people are going to be using it. And let's say Discord like ours, for example, doesn't have as much, not fun, but as much important things like you guys do, which makes it obviously...

way better and way more advanced because not because they have to pay extra or not because our picks hit more or you guys less or you guys more us less, but because it brings value and education. And that's, you know, I think that's number one thing too.

Yeah, and then another thing is, like, we're going to– we're building out an extremely good funnel. So one is, first, every single user that joins the server is going to get our Dropout Degence bot to tell us where they came from. So we're updating all of our invite links, and let me pull up our super base for this. Okay. And I'm actually like, I don't know how to code at all, but I use Cloud a lot and a lot of AI tools.

So I'm very comfortable with our backend.

I love Cloud. It's actually amazing. I love Cloud Code. I have three accounts that I pay for or get paid for. Like I use it to the max. But like basically we also have like 15,000 users, but like... 15,000 where?

Half of them already got banned because they were bummed. They're at our music table. If I go to our manuals...

The 8,000 people right now are the actual people.

I would say it's about 1,000 to 1,500 monthly active. Actually active, it's less than 100. The best way I would say is I haven't had the staff behind me, so I've been trying to both Listen the discord and we get re-engagement but I've also like Been trying to read get the staff onto this so it's been like a little struggle So I got him on too early last month.

So they really were not as ready like with the content, but they were Yeah, let me ask you so How many people do you have right now in your staff?

So our staff currently has...

We have four analysts, two moderators and one developer.

Okay, and one developer in apps specifically, AI and... In that area?

Back end, front end. Got it, got it.

And you are obviously as a owner of the Discord, because of the work that they do, you obviously Paid all of them or are they getting the free, you know stuff from sponsors? That's their pay kind of value Basically, let me break this down.

So basically how the server works is I have this written out as well in my notebook. So basically, right now Um, There is 20% of revenue that gets taken off the top that goes straight to our bonus funds. And the bonus funds is just defined as our server. Like we pay for everything, marketing expenses, anything in the bonus funds. And if it's negative, like meaning we pay more than we have in the bonus funds, I just cover it out of pocket.

And it just gets reimbursed when the bonus funds goes up. But basically we just take 20% of the monthly revenue and it goes straight into our reinvestment fund. And so that's how we stay operationally stable. And that's, and by the way, when I say payments, I'm referring to the sum of our partnership and subscription revenue over a monthly period. Yeah. Bonus and so basically the way I'm running things now is very conversion based So actually I could pull us another screen share for this So yeah, my staff are getting access to this database or it's not a database, but it's more of like a calendar But I'm gonna have all of our job out DJ's content in there But basically all of our partners are loaded up in here and so Basically, we assign all of our partners a points value.

And so it depends on how Got it. Got it. This is how we are incentivizing our staff to do conversions. And then another thing that I will mention is that everybody, and this goes back to the custom invite links, is we're updating all of our invite links to be from a specific person. So every single person will get a specific invite link and we will track every single member who joins the server. So we're tracking a lot of demographic information.

Let me pull this up. It's actually in this channel. information so like we know actually what people's they are in, like people can use our partner Promobot and they tell us, this will suck, this will be really shitty, but I can say I'm in California. But like, this actually needs to be updated 'cause like they, You can use DFS right or no I can get what?

The DFS apps.

Yeah, I should be able to. Let's see. Or never mind. Wait, like for example, like better and...

Yeah, better.

I think I can. I mean, I should be fine.

I have underdogs, so I should be fine. Yeah, I have underdog.

I have okay. Yeah, I had an apple. I had it. I don't have draft picked draft kings, but Okay.

Yeah, so you'll have all of our like dfs partners, which will be good uh, but like basically you can all of our Basically, everybody can use this bot and it helps them see what partners are actually available And also the other thing about these partner promos is like they're free money Like you sign up and you deposit 100 and you get an 100 match like if you're smart better advantage of that like so really like Those are kind of like the positions are pushing and also getting value from and then something else We're kind of building out is that one that you can click into these and you can actually mark them as claimed And so if you claimed it with the dropout GD and so in the future, we're gonna build it So if you click this button, it'll automatically open you a ticket and so It'll also send a command to the mod staff.

And so we're gonna give everybody who signs up for one partner seven free days. So it'll send a command. So all they have to do is show proof and the mod can just approve it. And they get seven free days automatically applied. And then we can just follow up right in that ticket and say, cool, we'll actually give you 10 more days right now. And then this is where like kind of your sales thing can get in.

Okay, 10 days is enough. Okay, we'll give you two free weeks. Like,Yeah.

That's like really the--And okay, one question. Mm-hmm. Uh... I agree with all of this, but on question, do you do social media specifically, social media marketing or anyhow, like posting videos or because I've tried, I think I've tried contacting you with TikTok or I I don't know, it was YouTube. Not YouTube, sorry, Instagram. But I couldn't really find the account. Is there an account for... The dropout degens?

We haven't been active since early 2025, and it's something that's really on my forefront list. But right now, what I need to focus on is actually, I would say that we're not fully active. I put us in a couple stages. So first we need to finish being like education first. Like we need to update like all the value things. We need to make sure they're updated in there. And so our timeline for that is like within the next couple of days that everything is going to be finished and updated.

I need to get back on the phone with my dev. I need to give our docs to AI one more time and have them like just help me populate some more channel messages. Okay, so this is one more cool thing that I'll talk you through is that basically every single person who joins the server is going to get a ticket created for them. So they will get a ticket in the server, and it's not live right now because there's a development bug, but basically the staff will be...

Yeah. cycle and then the next aspect of that is that When they're three they don't have to put in their card nothing for this and they also get messaged a seven-day free trial that they do have to put their card in So that's kind of our if you want some free days you put in your card But if you want three free days no strings attached do this But another thing that it does is that when this expires?

Everybody is going to get a ticket in the expired sub channel. So basically like They will we will be able to get re-engage them in that ticket and then say okay. Sorry We don't want to make you pay again, but if you want to get some free days. Here's another chance to Got it.

Okay. Yeah, yeah. Hmm. I'm just thinking I'm just thinking right now. rank two Do some math because this is numbers game Okay, I'm gonna ask, you know A weird question, but I'm just going to be straightforward because that's how I am just with everyone. Yeah, so... What?

Do you think is your monthly revenue right now, revenue, not profit, revenue, just off of dropout degents itself without paying any of your employee uh you're obviously the team yeah for now so yeah so we currently our revenue is about a thousand per month uh and we're pretty stagnant uh dropping a little below that dropping staying a little above but like we're stagnant around that um for the past like two or three months or actually probably like four or five months i would just say six months just to give you that longer range But like, and the other thing about this is like, we're really wanting to wait on our server acquisitions because we're gonna, one, we're gonna do a server re-engagement.

And then two is the aspect of we can pay actually insane amount per customer because they will pay have the potential value of like $1,500. And we've paid previously like 25 cents, 35 cents per customer. And we're actually gonna be paying that probably about 50 cents per customer with this new listing we're doing. So we're really gonna just try to be focusing on how well can we convert this listing into actual conversions?

Because really, if we can pay like $1,500 a dollar per customer or like five dollars per customer even if we get a just one conversion out of 10 of, or, 50 of them gets your money back instantly. So it's like, we have a lot of, we have a lot of, uh, room to grow. And so like, so I would project us, our monthly revenue is gonna be probably about like, I want to say about 5k, but I could see it in the upper limits of 10k in a couple months.

But we need to just do a server re-engagement and then start like just our marketing. And there's a few more people that I'm talking to that are just going to like bring in a bunch of members to the server, like server acquisitions that I'm looking at.

And so we're just going to have like, we're going to have so much partnership revenue a couple of months. couple of months.

And Do you think... Who do you think has... Let's say we agree and I agree, I talk to my friend, we realize that this is the right thing, this is the right deal. We go in, we become a team. What do you think? Out of everyone on the team It's a bad question. Let me rephrase it. How much value do you think people like us have where we focus on we focus on giving out the picks analyzing the picks where we know the sports we know when and how and with you know who how which and when where we know everything about sports how much do you think the value of us is compared to let's say your analysts compared to let's say You said you're a backup creator or...

That's what you said, I think. You're a developer, yeah. So how much do you think the difference of the value is? Who do you think would have more value? Because in my opinion, I think in this industry, In sports betting overall, of course, education matters. Of course, you want to teach people, you want to give something to people. But if you have something to give, which means you have value, I've always been taught and that's my one way of going.

The only way we can make money off of people is to bring the value that we have. and make it not only educational, make it worth the money that they spend, which means, look, if we're focusing on sponsorships, we have to focus on getting the sponsorships and improving our picks, which brings more sponsorships or more sponsorships lead to more picks, which means the value that me and my friend bring in the sport specifically is we're going to hit most of the time, which is value, which is time, which is analysis, which is knowledge.

And people are ready to pay for it because like I said, We had 100 members, right? Just an example. We had 100 members. and nine of them Were in the VIP which means they were constantly Paying us to give them picks that which they were hitting we would stay up until 3:00 a.m With all nine of them we would not hop on the discord, but we would text in the chat Wet together and get the pics and we would actually go crazy with the pics because we would it would hit every time So I think it's a lot of value that we're gonna bring and I want to see how much Right now Right now we have one with because I told them I told the discord members because I was taking a break a month.

I told them I am gonna have to step away because I didn't know it's gonna be for a month. You know, it's LA It's crazy situations going on.

So So one of the two acquisitions I'm looking at are with servers of one has a hundred premium members in it actively and then the other is I think it's 150 or 200 So yeah, basically when it comes to the percentages that we have our analyst base at 2% so basically they See two percent of the monthly subscription and partnership revenue and they're also eligible for the five percent conversion base so basically What we would look at is for value is like yes, you can bring value to the server But are you actually producing revenue for the server?

So if your value doesn't convert to revenue then it's really not a good investment to like bring that much percentage course Yeah, so what were so like when it comes to like that? We yeah, we would be I'll be open to talking but like basically our analyst base at 2% and We would be open. So we track everything. So you would get your personal invite link. Your friend would get your personal invite link.

And we would know exactly everything about every member that's coming in from the server. How many partners they convert on. How many months they're active in our premium. And I would definitely be open to increasing from a base. But the couple of things I'm also looking at right now in my future are these other two. server acquisition acquisitions where I actually would have to give up from I'm probably gonna be looking at like around 5% for those people just for reference and so basically like It would be yeah, I would be very open to it But it would be very based on like you remember that you're bringing to the server and also like if you're able to Convert the current members the value Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

And That makes sense. And One thing I'm going to ask, another question just to be clear. What is the... How many VIP members do you have and how much is it currently? It's...

49 you said or 39 so right now it's 15 a month and we have like sub 50 right now um we're um but we also are uh i think we've done like i think we did four or five hundred in our partnership revenue last month um so it's pretty slow um to be honest but it was like not bad uh for like honestly not doing anything just like we let me be completely also been sustaining some pretty good organic growth, and those have led to some good conversions for us.

But generally, when we start promoting on everything-and again, this is when it'll be very-more value-based. And then the conversions is-We're going to not only convert onto free premium, but just the aspect of they'll stay after they receive the money.

Mm-hmm. I got it. Okay, yeah, okay. This is... I actually appreciate this conversation. I appreciate you being open and calling to talk about this. I am gonna obviously talk to my friend or my partner I'll say because we are kind of a team I'll literally explain everything you've explained to me. Will analyze how much worth you have to us and how much we can bring to the server if we think or if we analyze and see that you know, it might be beneficial, but then we might have some things where Uh, I don't want to be...

bringing something that the server might not need. You know what I'm saying? Because we are very focused, like you said, we're like any other server, we're focused on the picks because we know that we are really good at what we do. That's the thing. I think tennis, I don't know if, I haven't seen a lot of specifically tennis discords or tennis and basketball discords where they consistently hit on...

daily basis where it's live beds and you know you can tell anytime If that's it, if I talk about it with him and it aligns with that overall idea, that your Discord and our Discord can be combined and we can have a partnership. I will definitely reach out to you because I think, you know, I obviously... Like I said, I've been a follower of your Discord and you have a lot of members, which obviously I don't want to go to waste, which is why I texted you.

7,800 people. And of course, less of them are active, but they were active at some point, which I'm sure you were happy about and you were pushing the thing until your school started. But yeah, I mean, maybe there would be an offer that I would be like Asia, I'm offering, let's say 10,000 for the whole Discord or just an example number, right? Or whatever the number would be. And let's say that this quarter you just decide that, you want to focus on school or you want to decline.

whatever it is, maybe me and my friend would want to buy it out from you. I just want to ask if you would be open to buying it out. Or you would be more focused on continuing and, you know, kind of trying to get it up from the inactiveness that it's been in right now.

So, um... So when it comes to buying it out, like I would always be open to an offer, but I do also want to say like a lot of the things that we are building and are built around is based off of like financial. things that I've built. Um, so like there would be, there would be a lot of friction, I would say probably, um, if there, if I didn't have the ownership aspect, um, and it would just be like, um, but yeah.

like it would be in your decision to do at that point. But you would have to do like, there would be a lot of things that you wouldn't know how to take advantage of.

Of course.

But like, and there would also be the aspect of like the relationships. Like I'd be completely open to handing them over. But like those are very things you also have to maintain.

Of course, yeah. Discuss and see the percentages or how it's going to work and maybe the pricing overall may be, you know, increasing. I understand. Yeah, it's a community you've built. It's a business you've built, obviously. And... You know, it's, of course, it's not in its peak right now, but it still has a lot of value and a lot of resource, which most of the formative. sports bettors don't have and you are one of the I'm safe Founding...

you know, founding people. any fathers whatever uh you know discord communities of course sports betting specifically And yeah, I mean... I will definitely bring it up with him, talk about it with him. And... I was looking to... offering in my head, I'll give you a number. off the top of my head, which I was, You know, just wanted to give the number after you confirm if you want to sell it or not. The number I was looking at was...

$10,000 And if you would want to keep something and you would set most of the, you know, not expectations too, but, you know, it's going to be... obviously my own promise and you know i think we've had a conversation for like 30 minutes now where you can see that i am serious about this and i would not mess up whatever you've built and maybe obviously there's going to be some changes maybe some different focuses and if you would be okay with working Maybe still working with the Discord, still being in it and still contributing, you know, with the percentage, but still us buying it out, like I said, in a sense where we focus on it, we buy it out from you, we're the owners now at the moment and we handle and manage it, but you still have a high role where, you know, you maybe have your own...

channel or maybe your own the part of discord where you handle and you get percentage off of it or you get a certain percentage whatever it might be you know that's cool just let me know what you think about the overall number and where your percentages are.

So if you would be interested, just to give you a little bit of reference and, um, and this, of course, any numbers would take a lot of consideration on my side. Um, but in November when we evaluated the business, um, at about like $2,000 of monthly revenue and our projections to increase, which they didn't increase, but, um, just because I didn't put any effort in, I tried to acquisition that, uh, just didn't, uh, uh, hire more people um and then yeah they didn't uh work um and then i just didn't put anything in for the next couple months um so like basically our valuation at that point was about 35 000 um and realistically um for a number wise um that is a very fair offer for our very valuation right now and i will have to consider that um but the also the other thing i do have to consider is that um if we could even like for example revenue about 500 on average, we'd be looking for about like four to five X of that value.

And that would be in a couple of like, Ideally, one to two months. So that would probably be like where I'd be at and I'd have to reevaluate after that like a month period.

Got it. Got it. So you said 35,000 you're looking at?

When we estimated our company value, in November of 2025. Got it.

And... was the... Because the number that I'm giving is for... I think the reason why I think The 20,000 drop is valid. Just to justify, you don't have to agree with me. I think it's because of inactivity because I've, the discord I've had, I've had one before too, not about betting. It was about stocks and I do have another friends that do stocks specifically. scored up around 400 people. it does require a lot of time and a lot of obviously, you know, a lot of effort to activate a dead discord yours isn't dead obviously I don't want to say it's dead but From what you said, there's 100 people active.

regularly. and actually active and specifically let's say we would i would put away the sponsorships let's say i would we would do regular sponsorships that you have on regular you make you know most of a profit off of that or maybe all the profit let's say you have that and we still offer you the same amount. So you're still making off money off of the sponsorships, but it's under our management, which means we offer are going to focus on VIP more.

We are going to still do exactly what you were doing, which is education, learning, but we're going to offer the value and that value is going to pay off. the work the obviously the team and adding more people to the discord and etc that was just my evaluation of why i offered exactly that amount But You know, you could tell me if you disagree, because like I said, I'm straightforward with people. If you're disagreeing, let me know.

I'll talk to my friend, see what we're looking at, see if maybe we could even work together instead of buying it out. But yeah, I mean...

So what was that number again?

it was $10,000, 10,000.

So like, yeah, I would have to say no until I would have to come back in one to two months to reevaluate.

Got it. But just like given our current position and the work that I'm putting into, um, yeah, ideally just test.

Um, and if we, if we got 10 conversion or like 20 conversions, that's already, um, basically a thousand dollars in revenue. And that's not, That's not very hard to obtain on my own, especially with getting all of my staff on board.

Of course, yeah. No, I don't want to– look, sorry to interrupt, but I don't want to throw you off your– goals and obviously what you're looking for because like you said, you seem very passionate about it and you know a lot about it and it's your Discord. I want you to succeed. Like I said, I've been in the Discord. I want you to keep going, keep trying it out. see where it goes. If you ever think that, you know, this discord is yours still, but you're having a little trouble or you don't want to focus on specifically this part of it.

You know, the deal is there. Reach out. I am open to negotiating, but from the point and from the analysis that I've done of Discord, looking around it, looking through it, seeing the activity, seeing how people tell, maybe even offering you obviously the What's it called? the details because you are going to keep, like I said, you... If you were to buy it out, I want you to still be in the discord and by being in it, I mean having a role and value and making money off of discord because you were the one who made it and brought it where it is.

So if you ever try, let's say in two months from now or whatever the time is, you try and see that the discord isn't working out kind of, or you're tired of dealing with it. Let me know. Because I am open for taking it over and I want to work with you and I want to make this happen because I know numbers and I know this thing can blow up and go crazy if we put the right amount of work.

Yeah, and I will definitely reach out in a couple months after I've taken a bit of an evaluation to see. And also, after you talk to your partner, if you do... I do think that just more working on the conversion basis is something that you'd be interested in trying. I'd even be open to offering you just different deals if you didn't want to have as much. And we can talk about it, but basically it would be just mostly conversion-based and still the value, the premium, but the conversion and the actual value behind the partner.

you Of course. Okay, that's perfect, bro. I appreciate this call. This was actually valuable and I will reach out to you about the decision, about anything we discuss. I'll be honest with you. Like I said, you've seen me being straightforward with you because I'm not here to bullshit or give you one thing and then say one thing and then do another. I appreciate this call. Thank you for reaching out.

Thank you for responding. I appreciate the amount of work that you do for the Discord and for the betting community. And I'm looking forward to this, bro. I appreciate that. Thank you. And thank you for taking the time to chat tonight. Have a great night, brother. Yes, sir. You too, brother. Good night. Good night. We'll speak soon. Bye-bye.
