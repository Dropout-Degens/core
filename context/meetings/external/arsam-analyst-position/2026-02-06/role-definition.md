# Arsam — Role Definition — February 6, 2026

---

## Proposed Role

**Analyst** — specializing in tennis and NBA live betting

No formal role was agreed upon during this call. Dax offered the standard analyst position at 2% base compensation. Arsam said he would discuss with his partner Heiko before committing.

## What Arsam Would Bring

- **Tennis expertise:** Live betting specialization, watches matches at 2-4 AM, identifies momentum shifts and underdog-to-favorite flips. Claims tennis generates 70% of his profits. Believes tennis is a gap in DD's current analyst coverage.
- **NBA picks:** Both Arsam and Heiko have NBA experience. Heiko has hit multiple $10,000 WNBA parlays.
- **UFC:** Arsam mentioned UFC as another sport he follows.
- **Sales ability:** Works at AT&T in sales. Comfortable with DM outreach, VIP closing, price negotiation. Positioned himself as someone who could sell VIP memberships and drive conversions.
- **His partner Heiko:** Would also come on, effectively two analysts from one acquisition.

## What Arsam Would Be Expected To Do (Standard Analyst Role)

Per DD's analyst structure:
- Post picks with educational framing — explain the reasoning, tools, and analysis behind each pick
- Send screenshots of bets and apps
- Seed engagement in channels
- Drive conversions on DD's 40 partners using personal invite link
- Help convert members through the ticket system and DM outreach
- Keep bet tracking spreadsheet up to date

## Arsam's Own Server (BigBetLounge)

- ~100 total members, 9 paying VIP at the time of the call
- Arsam and Heiko were the only active analysts
- Went inactive for about a month due to work and school
- Recently restarted — been consistently posting for 1-2 weeks
- Posting on TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram (slow growth)
- VIP pricing unknown but they were charging for picks

## Potential Structures Discussed

1. **Analyst role at 2% base** — standard DD analyst compensation with conversion bonuses
2. **Conversion-based arrangement** — Dax mentioned being open to a deal more heavily weighted on conversions if Arsam didn't want as much traditional analyst responsibility
3. **Server merge/partnership** — Arsam initially framed the conversation as combining servers rather than a buyout, keeping BigBetLounge's identity while leveraging DD's infrastructure
4. **Buyout** — Arsam offered $10,000 for DD. Dax declined. Not a viable path at this time.

## Location Concern

Arsam is in California, which limits personal access to most DD partners. He can use DFS apps (Underdog confirmed) and social sportsbooks. He also bets on offshore sites. Same limitation as other California-based staff — doesn't affect ability to help members in other states.

## Time Commitment

Not discussed in detail. Arsam mentioned being in college, working at AT&T, and having been inactive on BigBetLounge for a month due to work/school. His availability was not explicitly defined.
