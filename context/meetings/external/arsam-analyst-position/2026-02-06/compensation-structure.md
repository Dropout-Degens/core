# Arsam — Compensation Structure — February 6, 2026

---

## What Dax Offered

Dax presented the standard analyst compensation model:

### Base Compensation
- **2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue**
- Same base as all DD analysts
- Requires minimum conversion activity (5 conversions/month per current policy, though not explicitly stated to Arsam on this call)

### 5% Staff Conversion Bonus
- 5% of monthly revenue allocated to a bonus pool
- Distributed proportionally based on conversion points earned
- Points earned by converting members onto DD's 40 partners
- Each partner is worth approximately $50 CPA
- Custom invite link tracks every member who joins through Arsam

### Growth Path
- Dax mentioned being open to increasing the percentage based on performance
- Specifically tied to members brought to the server and conversions generated
- Referenced the server acquisition deals he's looking at — those may be offered ~5% for comparison

### Revenue Context Shared With Arsam
- Current DD revenue: ~$1,000/month (stagnant for ~6 months)
- Partnership revenue last month: ~$400-$500
- Projected revenue in a couple months: $5,000-$10,000/month
- 40 partners at ~$50 CPA each
- Customer LTV: ~$1,500 across all partnerships
- Subscription pricing: $15/month, increasing to $50/month soon

## Arsam's Perspective on Compensation

Arsam did not explicitly accept or reject the 2% offer. His framing throughout the call suggested he values:
- Pick quality and hit rate as the primary driver of revenue
- VIP sales as a major revenue stream (referenced his friend's Discord doing $67,500/week with 1,500 VIP members at $45/week)
- Higher compensation tied to the value his tennis/NBA picks and sales skills bring

Arsam asked Dax who he thinks has more value — analysts who produce winning picks or developers/educators. His implied position is that consistent winning picks are the most valuable asset and should be compensated accordingly.

## The Buyout Offer

Arsam offered **$10,000** to buy Dropout Degens:
- Arsam and Heiko would take over ownership and management
- Dax would keep a role with a percentage (unspecified)
- DD's partnerships would remain
- Arsam would focus on VIP sales and picks

**Dax declined:**
- DD valued at ~$35,000 in November 2025 at ~$2,000/month revenue
- At current revenue (~$1,000/month), Dax would want 4-5x monthly value before selling
- Plans to reevaluate in 1-2 months after growth push

## No Agreement Reached

Arsam said he would discuss with his partner Heiko and come back. Dax said he'd be open to:
1. Standard analyst role at 2%
2. A more conversion-heavy deal if Arsam preferred
3. Revisiting the buyout conversation in 1-2 months
