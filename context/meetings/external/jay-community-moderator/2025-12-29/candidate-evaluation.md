# Jay — Candidate Evaluation — December 29, 2025

---

## Strengths

- **Trusted relationship:** Part of DD's original crew, no history of issues
- **Mission alignment:** Understands and believes in what DD is building
- **Genuine enthusiasm:** Wants to be a part of it despite time constraints
- **Network access:** Fraternity at U of M = organic member recruitment channel
- **Honest:** Upfront about limitations, didn't overpromise — sets expectations clearly

## Weaknesses / Concerns

- **Very low availability:** 15 minutes/day is the floor — not a consistent contributor
- **DD is explicitly second priority** — school, work, and internship all come first
- **No picks capacity:** Can't commit to analyst work, limits his direct conversion impact
- **Seasonal availability fluctuates:** Better in spring (settled into classes), worse in summer (internship)

## Fit Assessment

- Appropriate for the **mod role** as scoped — low-bar engagement, casual presence
- Not a high-output contributor — more of a community seed and social funnel
- His fraternity network is the most tangible value-add beyond passive engagement
- Commission-based structure is correctly calibrated to his effort level

## Decision

- **Hired as community moderator**
- January trial period — low expectations, orientation focus
- Full engagement begins February when commission system goes live
- Dax to follow up in 5–10 minutes post-call to assign role and initial channels
