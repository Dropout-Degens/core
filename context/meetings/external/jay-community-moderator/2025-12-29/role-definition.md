# Jay — Role Definition — December 29, 2025

---

## Role: Community Moderator

- **Not an analyst** — Jay doesn't have time for picks research
- Focus: helping members find value in DD's tools and partnerships
- Secondary: community engagement (reactions, daily poll votes, ticket responses)
- Tertiary: member acquisition via fraternity connections

## Core Responsibilities

- Respond to member questions about specific tools (Outlier, Props Cache, etc.)
- Help convert new members onto partner promos when possible
- Handle tickets: "Hey, if you need anything, let the mod team know" — one ticket per session where available
- Seed reactions in engagement channels
- Vote on daily polls
- Help members understand which resources are relevant to them

## Tool Access

- Dax to provide access to tools that mod staff can use to answer member questions
- Examples: Odds Jam, Daily Grind Fantasy, Props Cache, Outlier
- Jay can answer tool-specific questions for the tools he has access to
- Purpose: help members use the tools, not just receive picks

## Fraternity Recruitment

- Jay is in a fraternity at U of M
- Potential to get frat brothers to join the server, get them free access via partner promos
- Rather than a group chat for the frat, use the mod position as the entry point for that social circle

## Time Commitment

- Minimum: 15 minutes per day when available
- No specific hour requirements imposed
- Expectation: casual, low-pressure, flexible around school and work schedule
- January: very light — just getting oriented while Dax finalizes systems
- February onward: more structured engagement as marketing ramps up
