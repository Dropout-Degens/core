# Jay — Compensation Structure — December 29, 2025

---

## Commission-Based Pay (Points System)

- Jay earns **no base pay** — entirely commission-based
- Points awarded per partner conversion attributed to Jay's engagement
- Each partner has a point value proportional to its CPA (e.g., $100 partner = 2 points)
- Jay's payout = his points / total staff points × allotted staff commission pool
- Example: if Jay earns 25 out of 50 total points across staff, he receives 50% of the monthly staff commission allotment

## Timeline

- **January 2026:** Trial month — no payments, Jay settles into the role
- **February 2026:** Commission system goes fully live — first payments begin
- Payouts tracked and calculated monthly

## Bonus

- Top performer across the staff each month gets an additional bonus on top of commission
- Bonus structure TBD — to be finalized as part of the overall staff commission rollout

## Notes

- No financial pressure on Jay — very low bar, commission scales with effort
- Jay acknowledged the system is fair and he had no objections
- Structure aligns with Dax's broader staff incentive plan being built for all mods
- Full commission details to be sent to all staff once finalized in early January
