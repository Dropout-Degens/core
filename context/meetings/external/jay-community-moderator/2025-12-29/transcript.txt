kind of I got like 10 minutes and I gotta be at work in the morning so I'm trying to get to bed but like I got 10-15 minutes to hear you out you know I'll keep it relatively quick but like we don't want to just be like our main focus is to send you profitable picks like that is like what every sports betting influencer does to the community um I know who was that.

I thought that was somebody behind me.

Oh my God. That should be out.

I probably checked you out.

I'm alone now. I'm alone. Um, but, um, Thank you. We are... Focusing on that actually this is how you use the partnerships and tools that we have to offer. So kind of like each member is turning into like an analyst of their own. So they have the resources that they need.

It's focused on creating good bettors instead of just giving them good picks.

Like instead of just giving like just poor people the slaughter of whatever your analyst is telling you. Learn how to look and research and, oh, he says bet this, let me look on props cache and say, oh, the last five of this also hit, so maybe I'll check.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So that's kind of like the framing. And so the roadmap for this, what we've kind of got going on is we're kind of planning on It's basically... four stages. So the first stage is just like Thank you. Get all the education first. there The discord updated all of our staff onboarded with the mission and just like some of our just responsible gaming aspect and then just Getting ready to begin our re-engagement And then when we start our re-engagement, we're going to be increasing our prices to $50 a month We're releasing FLIF EV and also just EV for pretty single let me show you that real quick this will be live in The early January.

We have EV. That's for all these different platforms. We're gonna add probably about five more the end Yeah, I remember thrills obviously flip was like the original well, so we added We've got MDM and will price picks probably play Oh, wow.

Okay. Like, basically...

.

I mean, those are legit. That's a good get.

Yep, and so basically what this allows us to do is, let me just... as well is we can Let me just show you this as well is our data. What we do is we have alerts. We have like 200,000 of these. We get like 2,000 of these a day across all of our books. So we get a lot of data. And so what we can do is actually look back. And I have access to a data provider through my internship. So I can actually find what actually happened.

bet take this bet and place X dollars on it so now I can actually look and say oh when they told us to place this bet let's see how accurate they are and so what this allows us to actually kind of look at is when Let me just pull this. When the odds are from 110, this is a filter that I know, from 110 to 130 we have a very high hit rate. It's maybe 120. Let me just check. Filter of 120 to 130, yeah.

But when I apply this filter, basically, we would only send out Hit this filter Why is this? Weird. Um Ah. Point spread But basically, we have a basically 90% hit rate on this market. And so that's what we'll be sending out in our actually published EV channels. For example, if it's a football bet, it will be in football EV and hockey, etc. So what we can do now is take this from a 60% all-time market to a 90% every once in a while market.

And when I say every once in a while, it'll hit 90% of the time, but only then on occasion. And so Really just gonna be watching that as one of our reasons for increasing our pricing and also just the aspect of education first. And so we're just going to be basically And so it'll be, we have, let me tag you, or let me send you this as well for you to check out. We have a partner promo bot in... Support free access.

But you can basically tell us What? And it tells you what... partner available in your state that we have available. So this is one of the features that we're going to be having that just going to help us leverage our conversions a lot more.

And we're also going to be just creating tickets for the mod staff less than the analysts. But we're just going to make the whole experience-everything is, if you need help, you get an individual ticket. You sign up for a premium, you get an individual ticket so we can help you.

Uh huh. for the props cash bot and for also to help actually convert our members and say, hey, you should use this resource.

Get these dudes on to premium.

Yeah. Yep. And actually, we don't necessarily want anybody to pay for premium. We just want to give them free access. So we want them to convert on our partnership so we can give them free access into premium. Okay.

But I mean, what's the end goal with that? If we get dudes on premium for free, like in the long term, how are we making money?

So that's a good question. So basically, our partnership revenue, we get on average $50 upwards to $100 for every app that they sign up for using our code.

Okay, so that's like props cash and thrills and all those.

So not exactly props cash. There's a few exceptions. Basically, like the tools are the exceptions, but every single DFS app or social sports book that they sign up for, we basically get a CPA of $50. But what this works out to our potential LTV for our customers is about $1,250 currently. And that's going to be about $2,000 in February when I turn 21. Basically our goal will be to convert them through as many of our partnerships.

We can basically give a full year premium free and then the next year we'll start. returning a value of what dollar times 12 so $600 per year LTV That we can keep the house ever tense Okay.

I mean, okay, here's the thing. I like the idea. I just question, like, me specifically. I don't know how much value I can offer you because, like... Dude, I'm fucking busy with school. I'm trying to lock in on my grades. I'm trying to make sure all my GPA stays high. I want to bet. I enjoy it. Obviously, I enjoy sports betting. It's just something I enjoy doing. But I don't know how much time I have to devote to this.

Being a college student, I hear you, I hear you. I don't know. Like, I want to be a part of it, but it's just such a stressful time in my life that I don't know if I can really give you the hours to make a substantial difference, you know? And, like, if you guys are lacking analysts, I kind of get it. Like... You know, you need quality dudes to... to give picks to your members, but like... I just don't know if I have the...

hours free to really be a part of it. And I wish I did because, I mean, it's something I enjoy doing.

So, I guess...

It's tough when you just... Our full-time student.

I hear you 100%. And so one thing is like, if you don't think you have the time to do like the picks aspect, we could just I could just make you a mod. And you could just devote whatever like time you did have available to commit and just more be just help to focus on the conversions and also with the resource of kind of like fraternity aspect and getting users from your like, get some of your frat brothers to join the and rather than maybe having a group chat for that just mod in here and you can help to get them picks in here and get them free access in here and that kind of stuff you know Yeah, I mean, that's definitely doable.

But as far as being a full-time picks guy, I don't know. I just don't think I have the hours.

That's okay. I don't necessarily need an analyst. And one of the things I'm actually trying to personally work away from... work towards. like as an owner is to rely less on the analysts and with our EV it's hopefully just going to be really strong enough that our analysts can use the EV to make their picks and so then the analysts necessarily won't have much of an impact and the EV will be one of our stronger marketing points.

So Being an analyst isn't necessarily a huge blocker for me. at all.

Okay. I mean, I enjoy doing it. I could definitely do it.

I just wonder if I'd be able to do enough to... Like because you are actually to be a more educated sports better. And so like actually helping to help people find value in the tools that we have to offer would be useful on our end and then we'd also be able to I'm working on a commission based structure that we'd be able to basically reward you on That's like per member committed you get paid? So, I still have to work out the details because I'm onboarding a bunch of staff and I'm likely going to do a month trial in January and then push it fully live in February.

So, your first official commission payment would be starting February.

I mean, that doesn't really matter. How many dudes are left from the original squad? Not that many.

And I'm trying to get rid of a lot of them, to be honest, that aren't that active. But they just, there's just not that many guys from the original squad. But you're one of the few that was like probably, like... one of the more just like While you were there, it didn't cause any issues.

I mean, you know how I feel. I mean, I'm a, at the end of the day, I'm not 21. Like I'm a, I'm a college student. I like doing it, but... You know, it's tough to balance with actual school. Yeah, it is.

I'm totally down to help out in whatever capacity I can. Awesome. I mean, I'll get you set up as a mod then. Well, I don't know. Um... The pitch is a little different for the mods, but it's more of just like... helping the people that join the server and helping our users find value in our partnerships. So like, I'm just working on like, once I onboard everybody, like I have a bunch, I have access to a bunch of tools for free, like Odds Jam, Daily Grind Fantasy, Props Cache, Outlier, like I have access to all these tools, I can't use them.

So I'm I'm going to give some of the team access. You can be like... If people have questions and need help with a certain... outlier for example as a partner or perhaps cash as a partner like I would give you access that you could help with questions specific to that and converting specific difficulties for that partner if that makes senseYeah.

Bye. But that's the end of the day. I want to help out. I definitely like... have the capacity i think i'm able to but it's just a matter of time i don't know if it's worth it for you to have me on when i can only give you you know an hour a day two hours a day like i know you're looking for more than that so i don't want to lead you on honestly like if if it's all only an hour to a day that's completely fine but if you would be able to like make sure like you were at least there for like 15 minutes a day that would be A minimum?

That would be fine. I'm fine to keep you at, like, I completely understand. I mean, I'm working as well as, like, doing this and with my classes. So, like, I definitely understand the time struggle. So, like, I definitely don't, like, expect a huge time commitment. And then, like, with you. payment like it would be commission based so it just looked more So it'll be, I'll give a point value for every partner.

Like, so if one partner earns like $100, they'll get two points and that's the other one.

Yeah, I mean, that's the, that's the point.

Yeah, so like, and I'll just like maybe do an extra bonus for the top person. But basically you'll get, if you got 25 out of 50 points, you'll get 50% of the allotment for the staff commission bonus. So that'll basically be how it'll be just done on conversions. So, that'll be... That's completely fine.

Yeah, I mean, that's definitely a fair system. I don't doubt that.

And then the only last thing that I'd say is, like, we're extremely slow right now, just because, like, while I'm focusing, or, like, while it's basically just me, like, and then, you remember JP and Dante, like, Dante isn't doing, he's, like, once a week, and, like, And then JP's here daily, but we're just... Just trying to establish a base of operations and then scale from there. Oh.

I mean, I'm down to help out at that break, man. I'm trying to set the bar basically as low as possible.

I hear you, yup.

I'm working full time over the winter and then I'm back to school in January. And I've got an internship lined up for the summer, so like– It's no matter what, like... I hate to say this because, like, I devoted a lot of time to it. I get that you devoted a lot of time to it, but, like... Darabee Jones is always going to be my second commitment at best.

That's completely fine, and I would not expect it to be a curse at all. And if you do think you would want to make it, we can talk about bringing you on more then, but like... I'm completely fine for keeping the bar as low as possible and as low as you want for now. Because I definitely know you have the vision and mission aspect of it, which is what I'm looking for. So as long as that's...

I mean, I do feel like we've got it a little bit beyond– Just the professional boundaries, they obviously, you know. I mean, I don't know how to... Say it exactly, but I feel like I know you on a certain, just some level of personal extent.

Nah, you gotta come visit me at the Q's or I gotta go visit you down at Miami.

Yeah, like, I mean, you know, like... I want to make this work. It's just, it's fucking hard when I'm trying to also balance it with a major and with all this shit.

Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you 100%. Um. So I won't take too much more of your time. If you have any last questions or anything, but... Just, like, generally, I'll get you set up with a mod role, and then I'll send you, like, a couple of channels to help to be active in, just to, like, set a baseline, so you don't, because we have so many things, and also, like, I'm working on changing a lot of things, so, like, I'll have another update for you on, hey, this is what's going to be changing in the Discord structure-wise.

I'll have another update early January for that. But I'll just set, like, a couple of channels, And then we're just trying to like basically seed some reactions and then vote on our daily poll. And that's about it. Okay. Until we start marketing and engagement, and that'll be February-ish, and so we'll have tickets for every single new member that joins the server. So if you could get, for example, there's 10 tickets, if you were able to get one of those tickets and say, "Hey, if you need anything, let the mod team know," and then, That would be great.

But that's like... I don't think that's so crazy. Awesome. Yeah. And that's long term in the kind of when we actually just have everything in place to focus on the conversions and growth. Because we still got the partner bot that I sent you the message for. It's finished fully yet. And we still got to make a few more updates. But we're getting to a really good point. Thank you. Okay.

Yeah, I mean, I'm down to help out. I want to be a part of it. It's just, you know, time is obviously a factor. But as long as I can help out and, you know, with a limited time given and you understand, like... I'm not that free, but I want to be free as much as I can help. Like we can totally sort something out and it'll be better in the spring once I'm, kind of set into my classes.

Yep. And that works completely. We can just like... Just feel free to keep it pretty casual over Discord and just... I'll try to not intrude too much on your time and stuff. And just whenever you are available, I do appreciate the help. And just we'll keep it to that.

Yeah, okay. I wish you all the success. I do hope I can help out. You know, it's low down there in terms of priority. But I hope it works out, and I do hope I can help. Yeah, so just kind of let me know.

I'll follow up in like 5-10. I'll set you up with the role and then I'll add you to a couple things and set you up. Yeah, sounds good. And then click all I'll mostly just have more, like, there's just gonna be not as much to do. You'll kind of see like when like there's not as much when it comes to engagement, but it'll change in the next coming weeks.

Okay. Yeah, I got you.

Awesome. All right. Well, I guess that's kind of everything that I wanted to cover. Anything else you have?

Nah, that's it. Dude, Dax, like, bro, I really do want this shit to work out.

It's gonna be huge.

It's a tough four-year stretch for me as a student, you know?

Nah, I hear you. I'm definitely not an academic myself, so I hear you. All right. Yeah.

Let me know whatever you need from me. I'll try to give you the best I can.

Awesome. Appreciate you as always, Jay.

Yeah. Have a good night, bro.

You as well. Bye-bye. You as well. Bye-bye.
