**Type:** Recruiting/Hiring
**Participants:** Dax, Jay
**Role Being Discussed:** Community Moderator

---

## Overview

Recruiting call with Jay, a college friend and former DD community member now at University of Miami. Jay expresses genuine interest in helping but is upfront about severe time constraints — full-time student, working over the winter break, internship lined up for summer. DD is explicitly his second commitment at best. Dax pitches the mod role as extremely low bar: 15 minutes a day minimum, commission-only starting in February. Jay agrees to come on as a mod.

## Key Context

- Jay was part of DD's original squad — one of the few original members who never caused issues
- Currently studying at University of Miami, working full-time over winter break
- Internship lined up for summer — very limited availability
- Was open to picks (analyst role) but doesn't have the hours — settled on mod role
- Fraternity connection is a potential member recruitment source
- Commission-based structure not yet finalized — January is a trial month, February is when payments start

## Outcomes

- Jay onboarded as a community moderator
- Bar set extremely low: 15 minutes/day minimum engagement
- Commission-based pay structure agreed to in principle — details to be finalized
- Dax will set up mod role and assign a few specific channels to be active in
- January = settling in, learning the system; full engagement begins February
- Discord structure update to be sent in early January
