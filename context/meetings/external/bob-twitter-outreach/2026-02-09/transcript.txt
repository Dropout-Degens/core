more likelihood of getting those guys in. What do you mean? Like people I know?

So I guess like Are you in any what's your frat life like down there? Are you in a frat? No, no. But do you know any kids that are in frats?

I mean like If If you had any kids in frats, like we could give them free access.

And then basically if one of them gets on our, like we just give one of them to get on. on one of our partners and then it's pretty easy to get a lot of them onto our partners because One, they'll see it and then just we got it one convert them into the discord and then to convert them onto an app and then we'll we'll have a referral system in place for that kind of thing. And then the second thing is like As a whole, as a community, we've got a bunch of members and then we've got a diverse analyst team.

So we actually don't have, and so it's not as much about if you are sending out plays that can be played on that app. You don't have to tailor it to that. You can keep sending plays however you send plays. But it's just like you offer a lot of diversity in the community. avenues when it comes to the sports.

So what is your monetization from that actually look like though?

Yeah, okay, so like look when we don't really we don't have social media right now and Like... really just don't have like Well, we're working on it, but we don't have anybody when it comes to dedicated social media currently. But I guess like what it really comes to is like I just want to offer you a place to more like even if you aren't as available, that's fine. And I guess like the thing that I'll break it down to is that.

What how we like Like just how we offer our staff like payments. So like basically the way I look at it is like when we don't have a Twitter and if you would post our Discord, if you wanted to keep doing what you're doing and post it on your Twitter, but just have our Discord link as a place for people in your community and then like just that aspect. And then what we would ask on that side is just we would give you a channel and just the double posting of anything you would put on Twitter.

in the discord and engagement wise like it really it's not We're not, I'm not asking for anything commitment wise. I just want to give you like that community space and the commitment wise conversion is really what it comes down to payment. Let me kind of break it down for you. So the way we get paid through those partnerships is basically just a CPA. So everybody who signs up gets an average of $50 to us.

So we just try to just, and we're going to raise our premium prices to $50 a month, but we're going to basically just give free premium for everybody who signs up for our partners. But really what we want to like, And like-When it comes to payment, so all of our partners, just some of them offer pay more. So like on the up to 250, but most of them on the higher side of 75 to 100. But basically we have a point scale per partner.

And so every single person that you got to sign up through our dropouts code. And so we have a whole ticketing system in our Discord. So basically, if you were the one talking to them, and we would award you with the conversion. And basically how it works is we have a 5% staff bonus. And so you would get paid out of the staff bonus. And so if you, for example, converted somebody onto one of our partners that was five points, you would just get five points.

And if the staff bonus was 10 points at the end of the month, and it was $100, you just get 50 of that $100. And that's how it gets paid. And so the other thing that I would want to say off that is basically if you were to put our Discord link on your Twitter. We track every single member join from a unique link. So basically we would know everything about every member that joins off that link. And so we do award two, basically every user can be two points for every partner, or awarded points twice.

And so the first one is one, the person who converts them, and the second is actually the link, the owner of the link that they're from. You don't have to do anything. It would just be if anybody from your Twitter, anybody joined from your community from Twitter, joined in our community, and one, is able to take advantage of your plays, but two, is able to take advantage of our community, you get rewarded on that.

Yeah, and like Tell me more about your community.

What does your community look like?

community they certainly are like they're more committed to us I guess I could say but we're also in the early stages of it so We don't make We don't make a lot of money like from ads say right like YouTube I think we have 32 3200 subscriber but you don't make a lot of money right so we're gonna start doing longer videos like the betting aspect is not necessarily to make money it's more to push people It's more than just a question.

We know we're going to win. So we're trying to have people We'll see that and then we'llWant to watch our content as well. Yeah.

Another thing that I want to say is like, Um, like... For content wise, I would also, when it comes to the link and how that gets paid, I would also be just depending on how Like... If we were on a trial, but I'd be open to just giving you I do offer like percentages. And so I could also look at members of your team. But I probably have about 5% to 10% available when it comes to just the-we pay on a monthly subscription and revenue.

But we would have to just look at everything. But we would have-and if it was something that looks good for you, of course. But just when it comes to what we're able to pay. And then again, it's-When it comes to your YouTube and everything, it is hard for you to make money. And then it also is kind of hard to get that engagement. And then when it comes to community, the community doesn't have that much of a place to...

necessarily talk to you and we can offer that with the discord as well Yeah, and then, yeah, in terms of the actual constant communication,-.

something we're still looking into. So maybe that discord is the path. So, um... Yeah, I mean, I think I understand what you're trying to say a little more now. I'm interested, but it's probably not something I'm going to move forward with right now. But I'll definitely keep it in mind because we're in trial stages of things. So we'll see what works, see what doesn't. when we figure out what works and what doesn't, maybe discourse.

The right way to go and I'll hit you up.

Yeah, that's no problem at all. And also just... I want to say, if you do think you want to go down the route of partnerships for monetization, I do have some partners that I could offer, not offer you a code, but... Give you the email to contact their partnerships for so you could try to reach out and get a code for if you wanted to try that avenue for revenue. But like I completely respect and I love what you're doing.

So if it's not best for you right now, then we don't have to push it at all.

Yeah, no, but like I said, I'll keep it in mind and like I'll stay in your discord. Check in, see if it's something that, Yeah, like I'll stay in there. I'll just keep a look at like what you guys are doing. whether it's something that maybe interests me even more in the future. Yeah, I mean, I... Right now we're just in trial stages so it may not work out and if it doesn't maybe I'll hit you up.

Yeah that sounds good. And what's your Discord user? Is it SaulTO8?

No, it should be. Ah, Spieth Legion. uh... what is it Dropout DJuns right?

Yeah, what did you join? Or just say something in general chat. No, I'll give you free premium too. Check things out.

Yeah, I'll take a look at what your other guys are betting too. I mean, we already have our waste, but obviously, but... Like if I see like Hey, this guy knows what he's doing, right? That also convinced me to want to get involved with you guys, so...

Yeah, and feel free to check everything out. I've got the, right now we've got, Kaden has his own model in premium. I don't have my picks that are that active right now just because I've got the model that I'm trying to build out and putting most of my free time there when I'm at school. And then I've got Poro who's been a while. He pays for odds jam and he just uses that for his picks so he sends those out.

And then Luke has been doing this for like probably four or five years. He's... No, he's been around.

Yeah, no, it looks good. Appreciate it, boss.

Yep. All right. Sounds good. Thanks for the time. Yeah, of course, man. All right, have a good night, brother.
