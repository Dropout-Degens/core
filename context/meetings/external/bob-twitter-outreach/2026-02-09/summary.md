# Bob (SaulTO8 / Spieth Legion) — Twitter Outreach Call Summary — February 9, 2026

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO, Dropout Degens), Bob (external — Twitter/YouTube sports content creator)
**Purpose:** Outreach call to pitch DD partnership. Explored social media collaboration, community integration, and revenue sharing.

---

## Who Is Bob

Bob runs a sports betting content operation primarily on **Twitter** and **YouTube** (~3,200 subscribers). He posts picks and betting content. His Discord username is **Spieth Legion**. He does not appear to be in a frat or have strong college network connections.

He and his team are in **trial stages** — still figuring out what works for content and monetization. They don't make significant money from ads or YouTube yet and are planning to shift to longer-form video content. The betting content is not primarily for revenue — it's to attract viewers who see the wins and then want to watch their broader content.

## What Dax Pitched

### Community Integration
- Bob would get a dedicated analyst channel in DD's Discord
- Double-post anything he puts on Twitter into the Discord channel
- No commitment required — just offering a community space for his audience
- DD provides the community engagement layer that Twitter/YouTube can't (direct member interaction)

### Compensation Structure
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Points-based conversion system. Each partner conversion earns points proportional to partner value. End-of-month payout split proportionally.
- **Tracked invite link:** Bob gets a unique link. Anyone who joins DD from his Twitter link and later converts on any partner earns Bob points — even if someone else (usually Dax) does the actual conversion. Double points if Bob both invites and converts.
- **Revenue share (tentative):** 5-10% of monthly subscription and partnership revenue, depending on trial performance. Would also consider extending to members of Bob's team.
- Bob doesn't have to tailor his picks to DD's partners — he keeps doing what he does. DD values the diversity of sports coverage he brings.

### Frat/College Recruitment Angle
- Dax asked about frat connections for member acquisition
- Bob doesn't have frat connections
- Dax explained the conversion funnel: get one frat member on a partner app → social proof → others follow

### Partner Code Contacts
- Dax offered to share partnership contact emails so Bob could try to get his own affiliate codes for monetization, even independent of DD

## Bob's Response

**Interested but not ready to commit.**

- Said he understands the pitch better now and is interested
- Currently in trial stages with his own content — needs to figure out what works first
- Will stay in DD's Discord, check things out, observe the analysts (Kaiden's model, Poro's OddsJam picks, Luke's picks)
- Will keep DD in mind and reach out if/when it makes sense
- Was given free premium access to explore the server

## How the Call Ended

- No deal was made — soft landing
- Bob staying in the Discord with free premium to evaluate
- Door left open for future collaboration
- Both respectful and positive
