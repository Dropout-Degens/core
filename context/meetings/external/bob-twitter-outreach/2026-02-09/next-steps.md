# Bob — Twitter Outreach — Next Steps — February 9, 2026

---

## Outcome

**No deal.** Bob is interested but not committing right now. He's in trial stages with his own content strategy and needs to figure out what works before adding DD into the mix.

## What Was Agreed

- Bob stays in DD Discord with **free premium access**
- Bob will observe the analysts and server to evaluate fit
- Door is open for future collaboration — Bob said he'll reach out if/when it makes sense

## Follow-Up Actions

### Dax
- [ ] Confirm Bob (Spieth Legion) has free premium access
- [ ] No active follow-up needed — let Bob evaluate on his own
- [ ] If Bob reaches out later, prepared offers include:
  - Dedicated analyst channel + tracked invite link
  - 5% staff bonus pool participation
  - 5-10% revenue share (trial basis)
  - Partner code contact introductions

### Bob
- Evaluate DD's server, analysts, and community
- Decide if DD integration makes sense for his content strategy
- Reach out to Dax if interested

## Assessment

Bob's value to DD would be as a **social media acquisition channel** (Twitter + YouTube audience funneling into Discord). His team is small and still in early stages. Not a high-priority partnership right now, but worth keeping warm — if his content grows, the tracked invite link model would be pure upside with no cost to DD.
