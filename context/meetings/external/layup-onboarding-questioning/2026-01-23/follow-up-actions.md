# Layup — Follow-Up Actions — January 23, 2026

---

## Dax

- [ ] Use Owen's Claude Mom Test skill to draft the 6 question survey properly
- [ ] Build the questions into DD's welcome ticket bot (Claude Code bot already in progress — pending dev approval)
- [ ] Once live, collect responses and identify patterns
- [ ] Report back to Owen on findings — especially which of the 6 areas generates the strongest pain signals
- [ ] Test "profitable strategies" / "betting profitability" language in DD messaging
- [ ] Ask about spreadsheet: mom test whether members ever wanted to track bets or if it was forced on them

## Owen / Layup

- [ ] Send Dax the Claude Mom Test skill (reiterated from Jan 22)
- [ ] Build AI Discord bot version of the questions (when validated) — can be deployed on any Discord, Layup gets placement
- [ ] Use DD's findings to inform Layup product direction (bank account, profit-taking, savings product)

## Open Items

- Dax's bot code: still pending developer review and approval — blocks deployment of questions
- Question wording: not yet drafted — needs to use Mom Test framing, not product-leading questions
- Layup product roadmap: depends on what DD's data reveals

## Follow-Up

- No hard timeline set — Dax reports back when he has data from welcome tickets
- Owen available for ongoing guidance as Dax iterates
- Key shared goal: understand bettor pain points deeply enough to build the right products and community experience
