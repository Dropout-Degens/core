# Layup — Mom Test Recap Call — January 23, 2026

**Type:** Product Research/Customer Discovery
**Participants:** Dax, Owen Monaghan (Layup)

---

## Overview

Short follow-up call the day after the main session. Owen recaps the six question areas from the previous day and refines the framing methodology. The conversation clarifies the distinction between emotional hedging (locking in wins for psychological comfort) vs. practical hedging (EV-based risk reduction), and reinforces the Mom Test principle: ask about behaviors and actual instances, not product hypotheticals. Owen recommends Dax use the Claude Mom Test skill he built to structure questions correctly.

## Key Context

- This is a short recap/clarification session — no major new content beyond January 22
- Owen has a Claude Mom Test skill that Dax should use to design the survey questions
- Dax just coded part of the DD bot with Claude Code — potential vehicle for deploying these questions
- The data is mutually useful: DD learns what members need, Layup learns what product to build

## Outcomes

- Six question areas recapped and confirmed
- Hedging clarified: emotional vs. practical distinction — both useful for profiling, neither about product
- Question framing confirmed: ask "when was the last time you X" not "would you want X"
- Form framing suggested: "We'll give you expert advice on your betting profitability strategies"
- Personalized thread CTA recommended after form completion
- Dax directed to use the Claude Mom Test skill for question design
