# Layup — Product Ideas — January 23, 2026

---

## Ideas Reinforced From January 22

- **DD welcome ticket questions:** Embed the 6 behavior questions into onboarding bot
- **Personalized bettor profile + advice thread:** After form, open a tailored conversation
- **Claude Mom Test skill:** Use it to design question wording — Owen built it specifically for this
- **Language test:** "Profitable strategies / betting profitability" vs. current framing

## New Ideas From This Session

- **AI automation for DD's community questions:** Owen's vision — if DD runs this successfully, Layup could build a version any Discord can implement, with product placements baked in
- **Layup as community automation layer:** DD = the community; Layup = the automation/tooling that enables the education and profiling inside it
- **Separate product lanes:** DD learns what members need → builds community tools; Layup learns what product to build → builds automation for that

## What the Data Could Unlock

- **Bank account + tracking pain** → Layup fits perfectly as the betting-focused savings/bank account product
- **Profit taking pain** → Layup's core feature (daily savings + sports-based win potential)
- **Tax awareness** → Partner with a tax resource (or build a guide) as a DD education piece
- **Unit sizes** → DD's unit calculator gets validated or pivoted
- **Hedging** → DD could build a "safe bet" hedge calculator if the pain is real

## Positioning Insight

- DD should lead with "profitable" / "profitability" language — Poro's story (Googled "how to be more profitable") shows this is what bettors search for
- The Discord framing that attracts the right users = not "get picks" but "become a more profitable bettor"
