# Layup — Research Findings — January 23, 2026

---

## Six Areas Recapped (From January 22)

1. **Profit taking** — How do they realize their wins? Do they take money out?
2. **Hedging** — Do they hedge? When was the last time?
3. **Tracking** — Do they track spending? Do they care?
4. **Separate bank account** — Do they separate betting finances from personal finances?
5. **Unit sizes / bankroll** — Do they bet in units or use a betting system?
6. **Taxes** — Do they file correctly? Are they aware of their obligations?

## Hedging Clarification

- **Practical hedging:** Placing an opposing bet to lock in profits or reduce losses — mathematically reduces EV over time but is a disciplined strategy
- **Emotional hedging:** Betting on the other side because you're anxious about the outcome — driven by feelings, not math
- Both types exist among bettors; neither signals a bad user, just different profiles
- A person who hedged "yesterday" is highly engaged with strategy — strong pain-point signal
- The person who saves every bet is doing an emotional version of hedging — managing anxiety

## Mom Test Reinforcement

- **Ask about last instance:** "When was the last time you hedged?" reveals behavior; "Would you want a hedge feature?" reveals nothing real
- **Ask about their life, not your product:** "How do you manage your sports betting money?" not "Would you use a separate account feature?"
- Pain is revealed through stories: "I had a big win and then I just kept betting and lost it all back"
- Goal: understand how big the pain is, not whether they'd hypothetically use a product

## Form Framing (Recommended)

- Entry: "Fill out this form and we'll give you expert advice on how to optimize your betting profitability strategies"
- Questions: ask about last instance of each behavior (hedge, track, separate account, profit taking)
- CTA at end: offer to open a personalized advice thread based on their answers
- This turns research into value delivery — makes it feel helpful, not extractive
