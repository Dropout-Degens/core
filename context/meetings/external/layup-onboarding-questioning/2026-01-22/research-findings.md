# Layup — Research Findings — January 22, 2026

## Mom Test Methodology (Applied Here)

- Ask about what people **actually do**, not what they think they would want
- Ask for **last instance**: "When was the last time you hedged a bet?" not "Would you want a hedge calculator?"
- If the answer is "never" → not a pain point; if "yesterday" → strong signal
- Don't ask leading questions — learn about their life, not your product
- Follow the pain: look for "I had a big win and pissed it away" type stories

## Six Core Behavior Areas to Test

### 1. Profit Taking
- How do bettors realize their wins? Do they actually withdraw money or just let it sit?
- Pain: big win, didn't take anything out, then lost it back — "I pissed it away"
- Bonus signal: people who tried to take profits but failed to execute consistently
- Potential product: automated profit-taking tool or bank transfer trigger

### 2. Hedging
- Do they hedge bets to lock in wins or reduce losses?
- Two types: **practical** (EV-based bet mitigation) and **emotional** (feeling safer, reducing anxiety)
- Note: hedging generally reduces expected value over time — signals emotion-driven decisions
- Bettors who say "I hedged yesterday" are highly engaged with strategy/risk management

### 3. Tracking Spending
- Do they track how much they're actually spending on betting?
- Do they care? Do they know?
- "Tell me a time it burned you" — find the story behind the pain
- Spreadsheet relevance: why do people stop using them? Were they ever motivated to start?

### 4. Separate Bank Account
- Do they keep sports betting money separate from personal finances?
- If yes: why? (budgeting, clarity, discipline)
- If no: has it ever caused problems?
- Product angle: a bank account designed for this purpose (or Layup as a proxy)

### 5. Unit Sizes / Bankroll Management
- Do they bet in units? Do they have a system?
- Why/why not? Has not having one burned them?
- DD already has unit size calculator — mom test would validate if people actually want/use this

### 6. Taxes
- Are they aware they owe taxes on winnings?
- Do they file correctly? Know about Schedule C?
- Key insight: under current tax rules, losses are only 90% deductible — bettors pay tax on 10% of losing bets
- Schedule C filing (as professional bettor) removes that limitation — requires documented system + bank account

## Poro Data Point

- One of DD's Real Sports partners (Poro) Googled "how to make more money / be more profitable" — that's how he found OddsJam
- "Profitable" is the language that resonates for at least some users
