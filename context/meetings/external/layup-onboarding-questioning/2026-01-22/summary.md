# Layup — Mom Test Research Session — January 22, 2026

**Type:** Product Research/Customer Discovery
**Participants:** Dax, Owen Monaghan (Layup)
**Context:** Dax interns at Layup — Owen is giving guidance on customer discovery methodology

---

## Overview

Owen Monaghan from Layup walks Dax through a series of product and problem areas to test with sports bettors using the "Mom Test" methodology — asking about actual behaviors and pain points, not hypothetical product interest. Six core areas are identified: profit taking, hedging, spending tracking, separate bank accounts, unit sizes/bankroll, and taxes. The session is a mix of research design and collaborative brainstorming for what Layup and DD could both learn from running these questions through DD's community.

## Key Context

- Layup is a sports savings app that Dax interns at — members deposit savings and can win a % daily on sports picks
- The "Mom Test" is a customer discovery methodology: ask about behaviors and past instances, not product hypotheticals
- DD has ~20-25 new member sign-ups per week — a workable sample size for testing questions
- Owen is thinking about what a Layup product could automate for communities like DD; Dax is thinking about what questions to add to DD's onboarding tickets
- Owen created a Claude-based "Mom Test skill" to help structure questions
- Dax recently built part of the DD bot using Claude Code — waiting for developer review

## Outcomes

- Six core question areas defined for mom-testing with DD bettors
- Framing approach established: ask about last instance of behavior, not hypothetical preference
- A/B test language idea: "profitable strategies" framing vs. current DD messaging
- Recommended format: form or ticket questions + open a personalized advice thread based on responses
- Dax to add questions to DD welcome tickets and/or onboarding flow
- Owen to follow up with Claude Mom Test skill link
