# Layup — Product Ideas — January 22, 2026

---

## For DD (Immediate)

- **Welcome ticket questions:** Add the 6 behavior questions (profit taking, hedging, tracking, bank account, unit sizes, taxes) to DD's welcome ticket flow or onboarding bot
- **Personalized advice thread:** After a member answers, open a thread with tailored recommendations (e.g., "You should look at setting up a separate account — here's why")
- **Bet tracking / spreadsheet mom test:** Ask members why they don't use a spreadsheet — was it forced on them? Were they ever motivated?
- **Language A/B test:** Test "profitable strategies" framing in Discord channels, server description, and DMs vs. current educational framing
- **Server tag update:** Change DD's server description to something like "Empowering sports bettors with access to tools, resources, and knowledge to find profitable markets"

## For Layup (Via DD's Data)

- **Behavior profiling:** Use DD's 20-25 weekly signups as a test panel for the 6 question areas
- **AI form / bot:** Owen's idea — an AI Discord bot any server can implement that asks these questions, with Layup (or partner) placements built in
- **Sports saving integration:** Position Layup as the responsible gambling / savings layer for bettors who care about profit taking and emotional hedging
- **Automation layer:** Layup becomes the automation tool for community-based betting hygiene; DD becomes the community

## Broader Ideas Surfaced

- **Weekly newsletter / email recap:** Weekly summary of DD picks, analyst stats, partner tips — suggested by Deadshot (referenced here too) — would be good for email marketing pipeline
- **Personalized bettor profile:** After mom test questions, generate a "profile" for the member (e.g., "You're a recreational bettor who'd benefit from a unit system and a separate bank account")
- **Partner recommendations tied to behavior:** If they say they hedge → recommend Arbitrage tools; if they track → recommend OddsJam; if they're tax-aware → recommend professional bettor resources
- **Claude Mom Test Skill:** Owen built a Claude skill with Mom Test methodology — Dax to use it when designing questions
