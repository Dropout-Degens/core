# Layup — Follow-Up Actions — January 22, 2026

---

## Dax

- [ ] Add the 6 mom test questions to DD's welcome ticket or onboarding bot flow
- [ ] Write up the question content — frame around behaviors, not product hypotheticals
- [ ] A/B test "profitable" language in DD's Discord messaging and server description
- [ ] Mom test DD's bet tracking spreadsheet: find out if members actually wanted to use it or it was forced
- [ ] Use Owen's Claude Mom Test skill when designing questions
- [ ] Add the bot questions using Claude Code (Dax already coded part of the DD bot — pending dev review)
- [ ] Report back to Owen with patterns/insights from responses

## Owen / Layup

- [ ] Send Dax the Claude Mom Test skill link
- [ ] Follow up with Dax on results from testing — looking for signal on which of the 6 areas is biggest pain
- [ ] Evaluate building an AI Discord bot (any server can implement) based on these questions, with partner placements

## Open Items

- Dax's bot code: waiting for head developer to review and approve before going live
- Question wording: still to be drafted — framing must follow mom test rules (ask last instance, not hypothetical)
- Layup product opportunity: depends on what the mom test reveals about bank account, profit taking, and hedging pain points

## Follow-Up

- No hard timeline — Dax to implement when welcome tickets go live
- Check in with Owen once first batch of responses is collected
- Layup x DD potential: if mom test confirms strong pain points, build together or refer to each other's products
