# Cayden (Reachpoint Media) — Collaboration Scope — October 29, 2025

---

## Reachpoint Media Responsibilities

- **Social media management:** All platforms — Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube
- **Content production:** Daily video creation, reels, ads, graphics
- **Ad management:** Budget allocation, campaign setup, performance monitoring
- **Post scheduling:** Consistent posting cadence aligned with sports calendar
- **Creative direction:** Storytelling-focused content, build-in-public style

## Content Strategy

- Primary format: **reels** — highest reach for new user acquisition
- Core content idea: EV calculator walkthrough videos (e.g., tail all recommended EV bets for the day, show real results)
- Storytelling angle: behind-the-scenes, how the product works, why DD is different from pick-selling discords
- Avoid: basic "play of the day" graphics — too generic, doesn't differentiate
- Ad creatives: repeatable, simple, direct CTA — separate from organic storytelling content
- Content types:
  - Organic: storytelling, sweating videos, product walkthroughs
  - Ads: clean CTA, message-forward, compliant with betting platform ad rules

## Existing DD Content Infrastructure

- JP currently handles Instagram and Twitter (play of the day format)
- JP posts on demand via group chat instructions — same process can be used by Cayden
- Full access to DD social accounts to be provided
- Video editor resources: student editors, potential UGC creator on campus

## Growth Approach

- **Slow and steady:** Start small, test what converts, scale from there
- First month goal: 7 quality videos, focused on understanding DD story — not volume
- A/B test two different storytelling approaches before scaling spend
- Organic content and paid ads treated as separate strategies
- Success metrics: conversion rate per post, CAC, member source tracking

## Resources Needed

- High-quality video editor (cinematic storytelling style — not just graphics)
- Campus UGC creator potential (low cost, fast turnaround)
- Facebook/Instagram ad account access
- Discord access for product screenshot/walkthrough content
- DD social account credentials or posting access
