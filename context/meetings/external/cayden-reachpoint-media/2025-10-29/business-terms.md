# Cayden (Reachpoint Media) — Business Terms — October 29, 2025

---

## Equity Structure

- Cayden receives equity stake in DD valued at approximately **$32,000**
- Equity is assigned and vests immediately upon contract signing (effective November 1st)
- Equity percentage corresponds to a share of net profit (20% of total revenue distributed as net profit pool)
- Cayden's stake is defined as a percentage of that 80% net profit pool

## Ad Spend Buy-In

- Cayden's equity is purchased via **$5,000 in ad spend** — not a cash payment to DD
- Cayden covers the first $5,000 in total campaign ad spend (any timeframe — can be slow)
- After $5,000 is spent, DD assumes full ad spend responsibility going forward
- Original upper limit clause (1 additional week of spend) removed — simplified to flat $5K total

## Bonus Funds Interest Structure

- Cayden's monthly earnings can be voluntarily donated to bonus funds instead of being paid out
- Donations to bonus funds accrue **20% interest** when paid out at exit
- Example: $2K donated → $2K + $400 interest returned at exit
- Ad spend can also be vested into bonus funds — treated as equivalent to a donation
- Dax to write up formal bonus funds document explaining math and payout structure before contract

## Performance Metrics

- Primary success measure: **CPA (cost per acquisition)** — ad spend divided by new members acquired
- Secondary: **scale of acquisition** — total member growth over time
- Cayden's target ROI on his $5K buy-in: 3x return minimum
- Budget strategy: start slow (e.g., $100–200/day), validate funnel, scale from proven results

## Documents to Be Prepared Before Contract

- [ ] Cayden's job description document
- [ ] Exit and bonus funds interest rate structure explained with examples
- [ ] Onboarding process overview (server welcome, ticket creation, conversion flow)

## Next Steps

- Contract to be drafted after team alignment — legal review likely required
