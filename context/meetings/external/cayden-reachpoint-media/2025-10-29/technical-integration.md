## Conversion Funnel Overview (Shown to Cayden)

- Every member who joins gets a bot DM with server welcome message and access instructions
- Invite links are tracked per source — determines onboarding flow and member value tier
- High-value invite links (e.g., Fliff) trigger priority conversion targeting
- Free trial: members get 7 days premium per partner signup (first Real community offer: 30 days)
- When sub expires: ticket is created, mod staff converts member onto next partner promo
- Re-hit cycle: every 7 days a new partner promo can be offered to the same member

## Partner Promo Bot

- Shown on call — not fully live yet, launching ~November 3rd
- Members can claim promos with DD code
- "See details" section per partner with information on each offer
- Planned: auto-approval bot — staff approves proof, bot applies access automatically
- Emoji display and detail pages to be finalized per partner before launch

## Metric Tracking
