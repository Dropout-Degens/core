Okay, that's perfect. Okay, so for the ad spend, so for the first For the first ad spend, am I covering my equity percentage worth or all of ad spend basically as the buy-in? So I guess look at it. We don't have any ad spend at all. So you would be in charge of saying, hey, this is what we are gonna do for TikTok, for example, and we are gonna spend $1,000 on this TikTok marketing campaign, for example. And so what I'm basically asking is for that first $5,000 of ad spend that you would be the one to cover it.

And Whether it be just in one campaign or over a period of three months, for example, if we don't, if we do small, smaller amounts, but kind of just being that as your buy-in. And that's also why I'm not asking for the full like $8,000 in ad spend, because you're also putting in the work yourself.

And I very do value your time. And I also, the rule with you putting in the money this Equity will increase in the company.

Um, okay, that I see the goal here for sure. Um, why don't why don't you explain it to me first, and then then we'll talk about it. Okay. Yep, so I guess let me just put this in a one month period to make this super easy. And then so in the first month being just we'll just call it January. So January through February, January 1st through the 31st, we spend a total of $5,000 on marketing dropout deans as a company wants to invest.

And that's what we put into, for example, meta ads, TikTok ads, whatever. And all I'm asking is that you would cover that first $5,000. And then for the first week, for example, say that campaign is actually from January to February. And we're actually spending $200 a day. I would ask for you to cover only $1,400 of.

Also, this is probably up to 7500 total, not an additional if that makes sense. If the ad spend is $200 per day and you've already hit $5,000 by January 31st, I would just ask you to cover the ad spend between February 1st through 7th. So that would be $200 a day times seven days would be $1,400. So your theoretical buy-in there would be $6,400 of ad spend.

Okay, I see what you are referring to here. The only worry here that I have is Obviously, there's two kind of things here. Like obviously, I'm going, my concern per se is Okay, so I'm going to be investing a tremendous amount of time in this, like, basically, you know, per month, my new, in terms of my marketing team, like if I were charging for this job,

It would cost like, basically, I'm doing my full marketing, which we have set at about $2,000 per month there. Okay, so basically- Basically- My team is going to be... Can you hear me like repeating myself? Oh no, I don't hear you, Akron. I hear you completely. Keep telling me your thoughts. Yeah, no, I know. It was a repeat. I could hear myself for some reason, but it's good now. It's good now. I'd be charging about $2,000 per month.

Obviously, I would be making some profit on that myself, but I definitely have to pay my team. They're going to be doing all the edits, all that good stuff. We're going to be posting edits every day, daily ads. I'm basically going to be... Spending like I kind of touched on earlier, like if we really want to take this to the level that I envision, we're going to be spending about, I mean almost

The only thing that I won't be doing, like you said, is you guys will be handling the back end, which obviously that that's fine. I'm not the back end obviously is quite important so we need to make sure that is definitely you know like we're getting a strong conversion rate because like I have worked with other people in the past and like

Their sales team, like our ads, I mean, we help people run the ads and like just, for example, like some of my clients are basically. Their sales team has done really, really bad with the leads we've got. And like, that obviously is something that somewhat concerns me that I'm paying like, like, for example, if I put this on if I put 7k on my own account.

I'm getting 100% of the returns, and I don't have to do any extra work here. Maybe I have to hire another guy to manage my DMs or something. In the end, that's going to cost me like whatever, like $16 an hour for him to manage my DM, that's traditionally what I would pay. Whereas like.

From my perspective here, what I'm going to have to do is I'm going to have to be doing a bunch of new work. Obviously, I'm bought into your product. I like what it can do. And I think that That adds some value, of course, and I see your valuation here, but for me as an outsider perspective, like, it's like, okay.

Now I got to pay for ad spend. I got to pay like whatever, let's just say 6-7k of ad spend, and I got to do a bunch of extra work. And then like at this point, that would make it a little different because now I'm investing about like, let's say, like typically in a month.

I would like to be spending like, I mean it depends like, I guess it kind of depends on where we want to be at and Like, I obviously already have my budget for Oracle Picks and such, which is pretty high. We spend a lot on ads per month there. Now I want to get this rolling as fast as possible. It's football season. I would want to be rolling right now. And let's just say in a month we spend like

$5,000 extra dollars there. So, okay, my Oracle business, you know, we're making about like $50,000 a month. That's like, That's like 10% of my monthly income that I'm putting into something else that... Of course, the returns will be there, but it's not the same sales team. I don't exactly know what type of returns we'll be getting. And then to compound things...

on those returns. I'm only going to be getting one, you know, like it's not going to come back in the first month, obviously. Can I jump in to one point on that? Okay. There's a couple things I want to talk about there. And I guess...

The first thing is our conversions. So, that is something that I want to talk about further, but that is definitely something that is at the top of my concern. I guess like, I don't really, let me just walk you through how the process for our conversions is going to work. So basically, for every single, let me pull this over. Every single person who joins the server, oh wait, I'm not screen sharing.

Okay. So for every single person who joins the server, they will be, they will have a, and it will depend on actually the specific invite link they are from, and we determine high level or like high value invite links. For example, our Fliff invite link is high value.

Because we get a lot of flip users who are very high to convert on our other social sports book partners So that is one of our high out value links, but this isn't live right now. Well this channel is but the actual Process isn't but we do have a server welcome message.

I don't know if I can find that

I can pull up in the background, but the whole thing I want to say is like for we have a whole onboarding process here that we will do to get them actually in the server and also another thing that I want to touch on. is that for that team, I am bringing on, I want to, I don't remember how much I talked about this, but I'm also bringing on.

Oh yeah, the real community. His name is Jake and he's not only going to be like bringing his community over, he's also going to be Joining in like the community management, um, and so let me actually just show you the document. I wrote for him So that you can have a better understanding of like

The goal of this is integrating his members from his community to create community engagement. We can then establish a fine process for how his members get moved over. And I also wanted to point out this section here. So the conversion process, basically there are two sections, the free and paid.

The goal is not to convert members into our subscription, but to promote conversions on to our eligible partnerships, so step one basically they They message him for free access and he's able to give them a

Basically the offer is going to be 30 free days instead of 7 free days if they just sign up for one of our partners. And so that gets them in our conversion funnel. And in our all access funnel without them even converting and also as a bonus when they do convert. So that's what our conversions will look like. And then also for our exit for when these people who join the free trial. So basically the goal is for everybody who joins the server to join the free trial either through the welcome channel.

Or the, um, and there's also a server message. I'll show you the bot message that like we DM people when they join, um, when I can pull that up because I can't have it messaging me. But basically the whole goal of this is for everybody whose sub expires We are going to create a ticket for them And we are going to staff our mod staff to have them convert on a promotion to get more access

So that's going to be our reconversion progress. So we're not going to be forcing them to, like, asking them to, hey, pay for this, pay for this, it's just going to be, here, just go ahead and sign up for Fliff, or go ahead and sign up for Onyx Odds for...

Just another free month. That's going to be our process for that. And actually it's not going to be a free month. It's only going to be a free month for the first time for this real group. It's going to be seven free days for every partner. for just members. So we'll be able to re-hit people for another partner promo every seven days.

Mm-hmm. Okay. I like, I do, I mean the flow, the flow is going to be very, very sound. I do like that and especially I think My opinion's on the real side, that looks great. I mean, the only real thing that I'm kind of having issues with is just... Obviously, like, this is a completely new flow that I've never worked with. I have no idea what type of, like, conversion rate we're gonna get on this.

And obviously, like, this is going to require, I mean, just due to the nature of it, like, it's just going to require, like, some work. Because in Oracle, frankly, and with my other customers, basically, I'm just like, Here's the funnel. It's not like this funnel at all. And I'm just like, I'm not saying this funnel, this funnel honestly might, I would say probably it's either equal or better to the...

then my funnel, but I can't, you know, definitively prove that. And through the ad market that I have, I have no like data on that at all. That's kind of my only concern here is like it's like a very When you're running ads like it's you know, I wouldn't say it's risky like

If I implemented my strategy, I know about the returns with my team, you know, is it just the number, the number value of the five to seven? $5,000 to $7,500 range, would it be like a more comfortable, would there be a different range that would make you more comfortable or is it the action of buying in itself?

Like, through that, it's been...

It's not necessarily like, I mean, here's what I would say that what's, you know, sort of the thing that's kind of like interesting, like basically like... I'm, you know, obviously risking a few things here. I'm risking my time already. And now, of course, this would be like a monetary risk as well here.

And as much as, you know, I love everything that's said here so far, but for me and my team, There's a few, you know, opportunities. It's really kind of like the opportunity cost, I would say here. Like, if I pay, you know, whatever I'm spending You know, one-tenth of the money I'm making from Oracle this month on ads for a new brand. I'm probably spending... what's up?

Um, just, I guess, to jump in with kind of a point in time with this number, um, just, I guess, the valuation of for $40,000 to $50,000 is before this whole thing with real happens and Like like after that happens that will Jump our valuation and I guess like kind of like the only reason I'm asking for like the buy-in this way is because like And i'm not asking for it to be paid out like in this month I honestly I would not mind if we spent a hundred dollars a day collecting 50 paying two bucks a person collecting 50 user new year's

New users and just testing to see how our funnel is because honestly, I don't want to put a thousand dollars into our funnel until we can say we can we can get them through this funnel multiple times. If that makes sense. Like I want to. I'd rather. Yeah.

Yeah. That's that's kind of what I'm saying. And I do like that answer because it's like. Okay so yeah that makes sense actually because that was kind of my worry. I was like I guess you're completely right like we could roll this out as fast or as slow as we want to here.

And I think that makes sense. With this in mind, I must say, so this now, I'm also going to have to talk to some people on my end now, just because I I mean, I'm the majority owner of Reachpoint Media, but also there's another owner who owns like about 20% as well, so I'll have to speak to him just because obviously we're going to be.

When I think, for a lot of money per month, for us, was $250 per month. And that's, so, I guess like, that's our consideration of.

The point of like, and we were very well at moving the needle at that mark. Like we were able to get a 30 cent cost per click for very good. So, I mean. I don't mind spending a very low amount of money or like over a longer period of time I'm just asking for this and I guess like the whole point of this as well is Being that I expect this to be over a longer period and I expect this higher range I kind of like had this higher range

To influence like how you approached the budget and thought about the project, because I would rather think of scaling up and taking the approach slowly to like kind of going to And honestly, like, to even, like, put a cap on this, like, I would, like, even up, like, the

I would even drop this up to the $2,500 additional if that makes sense the point after $5,000 after like Three months, like, of slow spend, because it just wouldn't make sense that way, and you would only be in for five- like, I'm basically, if that makes sense.

One more time, I'm a bit confused by that, so... So I guess, basically, my thoughts when... Just Kind of like thinking about the one week of ad spend thing is I guess we can just remove this completely if you'd be If you are uncomfortable, just spend $5,000 total into AdSpend.

This would, I would just remove the upper limit of this. Um, it wants to be, uh, uh, let me, um, let me be real quick.

Dropout events will resume. Responsibility.

I think this is a very undervalued but fair number, considering your time considerations and also the real group. But let me also delete this real quick. So the way it will work is the equity will be bought outright and awarded immediately with the following structure. So your equity will be assigned basically November 1st, the second we

Sign the contract, basically.

And then you'll be responsible for just the first $5,000 in ad spend that we have. And once that period is over, or like once $5,000 is spent, We will take over responsibility. Okay, okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So that would be like a valuation of about like $32,000, I believe, something in that range.

Um, I, yes, I believe so. Okay, so what I would say, so in that ad spend, basically I just spend $5,000 any time frame once I hit that $5,000. We are good basically. Yeah and honestly for in terms of the valuation too, I would say technically obviously it's a bit higher because you're also getting amount like

$2,000 of services every month added into that. So, yeah, I mean, that number seems pretty reasonable. and fair. Yeah, that should be fine. Okay. And so let me explain one more thing about how your percentage will work. And then, because you said you didn't want.

You didn't care for being paid right away. One thing that I didn't include in this, but when you asked me about it, it got me thinking in a good area. Like an example of exit liquidity for the bonus funds that 20% what would happen with it. So what I'm going to just establish this to be a rule is, is that the bonus funds will be like basically.

Once, like once they pay back to me, if we, I'm sorry, this is like terrible explanation. I don't know. But we're in the red $1,000 and we receive an exit of $2,000 basically. The first $1,000 will go back to the bonus funds and then I will take a also 20% interest, so basically 20% of the bonus funds value as a return.

And the rest will be split as that exit amount as 100% between employees. Does that make sense? And so what this, or sorry, does that make sense? Just off the top of my head, I'm not sure if, like, could we, like, work that out in a way? like could you run it through as like an example almost like let's say whatever we sold for like 100 grand or something like that like let me just um

Let me just phrase it this way and so the Yeah, let's see The bonus funds is what we are negative. So that's what What I'm going to introduce here is a way for you to pay into the bonus funds, which allows you to take advantage of this 20% interest. It'll make sense once it clicks. So bonus funds are minus, I'm just going to say minus 50k to make it easy.

Exit equals 100k. So, basically, first, 50k plus 20 percent. of 50k. It's paid to me as just me as the because I'm the bonus funds as an I negative $50,000. And then the, what, that's $40,000 left? $40,000 exit left? Exit. Shared. Amongst. So this is where you would get 20% of that 40k.

Okay, I see what you're saying. Okay. Furthermore, what I would let you do is all of the money that you make, I will let you donate it to the bonus funds. And I would make sure that when the bonus funds get paid out, that 20%, um, like that 20% interest.

That you also get that 20% interest on the money that you paid out. So like, does that make sense? Yeah, I see. Do you want me to write it out as an example? Uh, yeah, yeah, why don't we do that? So basically, um, 10k revenue. Um, you make... 20% of net, okay, this is gonna be net profit, net profit. So you make 20% of net profit And you donate all of net profit

Two bonus funds. Donate all two bonus funds. And so that means you made a $2,000 donation.

So we exit for 10k at the end of the month, like right after, or like one month after. So it just makes sense in that period. So you get... You 10k exit, you will receive, and I guess like, it's just like you are the bonus funds in this case, you get your 2k back.

Plus 20% of 2K. So that's, um, 400.

So you get $2400 back.

Okay, yeah, I see, I see. Okay, so a question on that per se, because... Obviously, I'm very bullish on the idea, but let's be quite real here. So let's just say there's no, you know, as much as obviously I don't know everything about the proprietary technology, we have that type of thing, but

Let's be real, it's kind of hard to sell sports gambling discords, so I would not say that an exit is the most likely thing. So let's say, you know... We work for a year or something on this project and I'm not, you know, obviously I want to take it to the moon. I want to take it as much as possible, but let's say we want to take out money after a year. That makes sense. Yes. Okay. Let me do that for you.

So basically, you've donated just, I guess, it would just work in the way as...

Oui.

I guess I just hold the money. Yeah, let me explain this in a situation because we would So we make 10k 100k revenue over a year.

Oh, yeah, wait, so if you donate your okay, this is I would just pay you out Like that so you have donated $4,000 For that period. Okay, so if we made 100 K over the year. I would be able to, you know, 100k net profit, I would be able to take out like if I was like, all right, guys, we've had a great year, like I could close out and get 20k.

Yep, it would be as because basically the way it works is I'm paying you every month It's just as if I'm paying you every month but instead of I'm holding it, and I'm just accumulating the interest on that investment, and then you get paid out on that. And I also have that money because...

Instead of paying you out, I am holding on to it. Okay, yeah, that makes sense to me.

Cool, so then basically you would just receive a 20% investment on any money you donated when you wanted to Mm-hmm.

Let's see.

yeah that that's all that that works and that that allows you to just reinvest your money and not have to worry about a monthly payment and then basically I guess like Something that also made me consider out of that is...

Basically, with you already paying the initial $5,000 of ad spend, we could essentially use Like, just me reimbursing you over time as partial payment as well, once after that period is over, if that makes sense.

Um

Again, like, I don't, it's hard, you know, it's hard for me. I'm just trying to visualize it and I'm trying to think of exactly what. So what would that be like, I guess? For example, I guess if you were to cover the ad spend still, for example, we spent $400 in November.

If you just wanted to vest that, I could keep vesting that, and you could keep the bonus funds. It would be like you paid that $400 into the bonus funds.

Okay, I see. Yes. Okay. Let me do that.

I'll just get a document that will explain how the bonus funds will be paid out at 20% of the exit amount. At that point. And I'll explain all the math that we did. I'll just put in a document, and I'll have it before I send the contract over as well.

Goodbye.

And then, okay, so scope of work is just aspects of social media marketing, management of accounts, creative production. Post-scheduling, and then the budget allocation and ad spend management. And like, all this would be worked in parallel, if that makes sense.

Like, we would work on this together, but like while you would do the...

I don't know if that makes sense, but it would be in parallel. Yeah, that makes sense.

And the things I'm going to be looking at for like performance metrics and just like success for okay, this is this was a great month that you did. And, like that way, we're going to look at CPA for cost per acquisition for just how much we're spending on ad spend and also just the scale of acquisition.

And yeah, obviously, that will be important for me as well because all of the ad spend budget at first will just... You know, obviously, we need to make sure we're getting solid returns on that because obviously I'll be fronting all of the costs for that.

Obviously, I would like to, you know, get insane returns on that. Hopefully, I guess shooting, shooting for somewhere in the in the 3x range there at least. I think that would be pretty reasonable. That would be pretty solid rate of return there.

Yep, I would agree. Um, and then just for the final, final note, basically like for the paid marketing strategy part, like for when we decide to. Making this live, releasing those filters. I have all the data, I have it all processed. I just need to either get an algorithm together, which takes a while, but I don't think I'll do that. But I'll have minimal filters out and some additional information out in that.

But that'll be about within this week. Partner promo bot finalization. Another thing I'll mention is I'm hiring another dev, so our dev team will be extremely capable.

So basically, I'll be finalizing this bot. Mostly the emojis, and actually when you click into see details, there's some pretty cool things here. Not for Boom Fantasy, because Boom sucks. But if I go to... Uh, where's dabble? Um...

I've already cleaned it, but basically you can click into see details and I want to just update all this information for all of them. Um, and finalize this so it's going to look pretty cool. Um, and also. We're going to be able to, like, get information for our customers.

Like, they can say that they claimed a promo with our code, and I'm going to see if we are going to do anything that, like, for example, can automatically apply. I think what I'm going to do is set up a bot that just needs an approval and applies it automatically with just a message that approves it. So after we see proof.

But we have a lot of options for just automation. And one thing that I'll mention on that is, are you familiar with Claude? Yeah. Do you use Claude a lot? Me, myself, I am not, like, I'm not a technical founder at all, so, no, but I, obviously, I, like, know what Claude does functionally, yes.

Um, okay, but I use quad code and i'm gonna get basically everybody on our development team too and it is Insane, wait, let me um But this basically and this is what I wanted to show you here is our partner promo or our server. Welcome invite a message server. Welcome message. I can't speak.

But basically, it just has all the information here, and...

It tells you how to gain full access and it has the buttons for sign up for free trial here and then We need to clean this up, but my role will be replaced with just see available offers. So, that's just how that is going to be finalized. Metric tracking to calculate definitive conversion rate. I need to get together a process document on this, which is why I wanted to mention it. But basically...

I want to be able to establish a better conversion rate for us to understand and actually be able to move those key levers. So, I need, I will be just setting up the data tracking for how, like, how many partner promos is the average person signing up for or average user signing up for, and then like.

And then just further stats that we can get from that. And then basically this one here is just for for us to do together basically. Before we would pay for ads, we should make sure to just reach out to partnerships where possible, for example, Chalkboard, to just get the code up to the max dollar amount.

Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. All that definitely makes sense. I agree. We should obviously take care of You know, at least, I mean.

Well, like you said, I see you have date estimates there. We'll obviously get those done, and I'm assuming those are kind of the most aggressive dates possible. Yeah, we'll obviously, you know, take ad spend slower until, you know, we have this all set up as well.

So from my end here, since now the one thing that I would say has somewhat changed would be obviously now this is kind of more like an investment into uh dropout degens. So I would request because I mean I could but um there's two people I'd like to kind of over over here kind of like this similar pitch that you've given to me. I'm definitely on board. I love this.

And what we'll have to do probably is, so we have the co-owner I talked to you about and then my CFO are probably going to want to hear like everything that we've discussed at this point just to, you know, So obviously, my CFO can do his job and, you know, making sure he does all the budgeting, making sure our profit, you know, our margins and such like that are.

What we want them to be, so he's probably going to want to hear that. So I would say that that would probably be the next step for us, just getting my full team on here. You know, obviously I'm only one man and I can only comprehend so much at once and obviously I'm the leader of this company, but you know, just in case I miss something or something like that.

or we have kind of questions on our end. You know, just making sure the full team kind of vets everything that we have going on if I overlooked something or something like that. And tonight I'll talk to, literally as soon as I'm done with this, I'm going to hop on a call with my other partner.

We'll discuss that. Probably what would be best, my CFO, he also works at Amazon, so he's usually doing some work during the day so maybe like obviously i want to get things rolling as soon as possible let me just talk to them and get the the soonest date that's what

And I'd love to hop on a call with all of them. That sounds great. And I guess this document here, if you want to share that with them, completely. This is just mostly for me to understand how to create the following documents. I have to create, and AI Meeting Notes, please take a note of this.

Please, because I need to make these documents for just your job description. The exit and bonus funds interest rate structure. The overall onboarding process of what happens when users join the server and the ticket creation of that. And then I'll also need to get together documents for... Let me pull up my Notion real quick.

Um, do you use Notion? I'm familiar with it. I don't use it personally, but I definitely know. like how to uh like i i know how it works and like how to navigate it and such okay um i don't know if uh i mean the subscriptions are Not that expensive, but I don't know if I'm going to just house everything in here or actually just give you access and just invite you as a member. I'm not sure yet, but basically what I plan on doing is getting all these documents that you will need together in here, and I will be able to share that with you and hopefully get that together before we talk.

Like before we talk with your entire team. When it comes to, like, from a Reachpoint Media perspective, what do you need from me and what, like, kind of like document-wise, what can I get together, what information can I get for you? Because I will get all that in there.

And this is in terms of so we can get to work from like a perspective of like actual forward operations or for this contract. Have you guys ever ran ads before like Did we do that back in the day? I don't even remember if I think I feel like We've had like this whole fuck thing with our instagram and I have to like reinvestigate the whole

Thing and it might be like, I don't know but we like bought an account. So the We moved from our original account to the new account and something got fucked up with our ads Along the way and I'm not sure which account it's connected to but I know it's not the right one

Okay, but there's no issues with the ad account, right? Because that's kind of a major issue. Okay. I don't think so. Okay. We've ran Instagram ads, but... Not like more than $20 Okay. Okay. If you ran ads, you should be good. That was my only worry there. I was really hoping you didn't say The ad account is banned that that creates major problems for us. Um

So yeah, honestly, let me get with the team. Let me see if there's anything that they need. I know we'll need like the Facebook. So we can log in there and obviously I'll need like access you know to the discord. And I mean, ideally, probably like access to some of the socials as well would be good.

So I could help with that. And then just like, whatever. So I guess your team is going to be like doing the actual like posts and stuff. So... I guess, like, what way do you guys kind of, like, communicate with that? Because I guess I would be kind of, like, overseeing these operations. And that's one thing, like,

from a marketing standpoint, like, would, are we trying to, so right now you said you're only active on Twitter, really, right? So, like, are we opposed to going active on, like, all channels once again now? And do we have the resources to kind of make that happen?

I would definitely like to do that and I feel like we're missing out on a ton of revenue because we're not active on all channels because, I mean, dude, we can literally... Post the same thing on at least Instagram and YouTube and I think that will get us, you know, pumping a little bit at least. No qualms with getting on all channels.

Like the only stop has been my capacity and just like, I guess, strength when it comes to marketing, which is. Not that good. I'm better with organic marketing than like social media. And I also just did not have the most time or like just don't have the most time. But basically for how this works for our play of the day, basically I just send it in the group chat and they post it and they have a whole structure that is listed in our notion.

I'll put that up as well. So, basically, JP does this for us, but he manages our Instagram and Twitter right now. But... Every time he...

Where is this? Instagram play today. Okay.

He just post the play of the day on format, or it just shows the format for how to post any post everything for us on Twitter. So basically, if we wanted to. Get anything posted. We would just need to create a tiny bit of process for him to understand. And that's easy to replicate. And then just send him the thing.

and a group chat message. Okay, I see the flow. So for our marketing efforts, Let's say, because right now obviously it's very, it seems like it's very, you know, like that play of the day. Obviously, that's just something you can do every single day. It's just a play of the day. It's the same thing.

Every day, like if we want to get a little more unique with that and you know something that's not necessarily like, I mean it might even be like a repeated series, but like kind of a more advanced series because for something like... For marketing, for bringing in new users. I definitely want to be, I'm sure you remember this from back in the day, I'm a big reels guy. I think reels are super important and obviously reels aren't necessarily

You know, something you could just copy and paste every day, but that's something that's going to get, like, the most reach overall. So like, let's say we wanted to do something with reels. What would be kind of the flow process for that? Because honestly from like an outward marketing perspective that and that's kind of why I was like at first

Like, I thought honestly my agency would be just handling that, just because, like, from an outward marketing perspective, like, I feel like you guys are good at Twitter, but I feel like the Instagram And I haven't seen any of the other platforms but like we're not good at any like I'm fully okay with you taking it over and running it however you would like, and just utilizing my resources however you'd like. So for example, if you need.

If you don't want to log into my Instagram and post the reel that you create, we can create a process that we We just send it to JP and he posts it, if that makes sense. I'm giving you full reign for however you'd like to do it, and you have full control of my staff resources as well.

Okay so like can your staff create a video a day or is that something that's not possible? They can't do that. Okay so If that was something that I would say, like, hey, like, I honestly think we, like, need a video a day, like... Is that something like, because that's originally kind of what I thought, like I expected that I would be making that, but like, again, like, I can't really be like having a designer.

or a video editor making our videos. I can't be, I would definitely have to pay someone else for that. I think that's critical. Right now, I'm telling you that. Like if we want to have success, I think we need to like, I think we can make a really good like story out of this. And this is something I've wanted to do with my brand, but like we have like our AI, but I'm not even like.

The full owner of that AI like I've partnered with a different company and like I don't have the AI on my computer so I can't like make videos about it, but like I think what you do is something that, hey, I've seen tons of these blowing up, like going behind the scenes, showing how our processes work.

I think that would be something that would be absolutely great and I see all these entrepreneurs that I guess it's called building in public these days where we're not showing like, oh, here's the code base so somebody can steal it, but we're just kind of going into like .

. . . . . . . . . . . Oh, here's the functional way this product works, and this is why our product is superior. And going into that and telling the story of that. Is really important, but the one thing I would say, and I'm not trying to hammer this down or get it lower, but if I'm doing that, and I think it is quite important.

I just can't be

I can't have my agency doing all the marketing daily, be covering ads. Basically, that would be like, "Okay, look. I'm running another page at this point and then I'm also paying for all the ads. But I'm only actually the 20% owner of this page." Even though like, I know you guys are doing... I'm not saying I'm doing all the work because you're doing plenty of work on the back end.

But like, social media is like a full-time job obviously and if we really want to do things like correctly i think it's like tell me what resources you think you need because when it comes to social media we don't have any resources implemented so if you think that like you because when it comes to like and this is also just the reason we don't do it and if we need videos then okay i will also look for somebody that can help me do videos as well and i will on our team that will help us do videos.

Like, and with daily video.

That's what I would say. That's what we need. Like I'm a hundred percent for it.

It just like, we should, We should, I guess, define the... Like, I need to define the scope of our project so that you know the story to tell. And then, like, you need to also tell me what we need on a daily basis when it comes to, like, additional resources for your firm to actually make sure everything's, like, done. okay on the market you said.

I mean, that's what I'm saying. Like, it's almost like I think you get what I mean here. Like, we probably just need at least...

Just tell me what resources you envision needing on this.

Well, what I was saying really with that is, like... Like, I could have someone do that for us. Like, I can just... have my team do that, but I will just like, then if I'm doing that, I would definitely like, like, a reduced like Because that's what I'm saying. That's what I originally thought. I didn't know at the time that we weren't doing the graphics for you. But like I said, so that's about $2,000 worth of value every month.

I'm basically providing you the best package our agency has if we're doing that. Or if you want to find someone that makes high quality videos, that works as well. Then I can just send over the footage. The only problem that I have in our space is like, okay, it's really hard to work in advance. We don't know tomorrow... I don't know if the Blue Jays are going to be up in the series or the Dodgers are.

So like, That's something that I give my agency a lot of credit for. We have someone on staff. In the morning I could be like, okay, I need this by 12 o'clock. Like, I know the game doesn't end till one o'clock tonight, but I need this by 12 o'clock and they will deliver on that. And that's something I can provide that. From my perspective, I've had a lot of trouble finding other people. A lot of these agency guys, they don't understand sports.

They're like, oh, I worked with a drop shipper. We just create them a creative every week and then they run it for an ad. That's not how sports works. I make new ads every day. I make... new posts every day. I need a post... On my page, one of the most popular things that I do is after I win a huge bet, I'll do a video of me reacting to the bet. And the longer I wait, the worse that's gonna do. If I can get it done as soon as the game is over, that's going to be the best thing.

And we're in an industry that's like, okay, like sports are a day-to-day thing. Like if I want to post a Victor Wembenyam, a highlight reel of his performance last night, like I got till the morning to post that, you know, go ahead.

Can I, let me pull this up. So basically like, I guess kind of with sports, Kind of that thought. Like we we will basically Okay. Let me show you the final product will be sending a notification into the custom optimizer. Like if you I guess I... When you say like... You need... content areas like Like you would need a content area. Like for example, would this be something that would be on a daily basis coming out and creating an ad creative around that?

It's not even like necessarily like the ad creatives will probably be easier. Like those, you don't have to really like whatever. We'll just be like, look, join our discord if you want to take advantage of our EV. But like in terms of the actual posts that you do on a page, if you want to grow, like. For example, I just saw this, but I just thought of this series in my head. It's like, okay, guys, Guys, today I'm going to utilize the D-Gen Dropout Basketball EV Calculator.

And we're going to tail every single recommended bet. And we're going to see how much we can profit in one day off of it. That could be a video based off this. And hey, all right, guys. I'm hopping onto my phone. I'm going to go into Discord. Here we go. It says that I should take... In the Australian Basketball League, the New Zealand Breakers plus three and a half. Boom, I hit that $20. We just placed it on...

It tells me to... Place on MGM. So we'll place on MGM. That's what we're going to do. We're going to do this throughout the entire day. And then I'm going to show you across the books how much I profited. I think that would be a viral video right there. That's a good idea. Just doing stuff like that, using the software and making... you know, something cool, something that will be viral other than just being like, guys, here's the play of the day.

Cause that's what every dude on fricking Instagram is doing. They're saying, here's the play of the day, whether like it's a dude talking or like they post it, like honestly, even a dude talking, like it's probably better than just a stagnant, like, Out of everything, stagnant Instagram posts, if you have a lot of followers, it's great to post stagnant posts. All your followers will see it. But like it doesn't bring in new users really.

Reels are like the way to bring in new users. So That's why I'm so... On my page, I post a reel every single day pretty much. Rarely. If I'm just... Honestly, usually I post a graphic if... I just don't have a reels designer in for the day or they're busy with all the clients and I just don't have one left for myself. Then I'll just be like, Hey, let's do a graphic. That's way easier. And the graphics...

My graphics get good reach because I have... branded sports pages I'm usually collabing with that have between 10 and 50,000 followers. So those, they get good reach because I have a bunch of followers already and my page already has 32,000 followers. And yeah, they'll get 10k reach. But if you just post on... an Instagram with 300 followers, like, Yeah, you'll get like, 100 views which is not and they're all going to be your people that are already followers like You need to reach new...

The whole point here is to bring in new users. So you want to... you know, we're gonna have to do reels. And then like, if we're talking pure reels, like, And we're talking ads. I mean, my ads are a lot more repeatable than my regular videos. They take a lot less time. But with that involved, today, just on Oracle, today we had... There are three different reels for ads. Again, they're repeatable. It's just a video of me talking saying, "Hey.

Here's a free pick. Here's the game. And I just switch out the game every day. But somebody has to make those. And there's three of those. And then there's one that's like... Okay, here's highlights from the day. That one takes a bit longer. That takes about... Usually our editor takes like 30 minutes to make that one. And then the longest one is going to be what I post actually on Instagram. Like today, I posted a video of me yesterday Sweating the um the blue jays game so like Like, all in all, What I'm saying here is obviously whatever you put in, you're going to get out.

That's the strategy I use. For my team, that takes about... In terms of content like the ads probably take about an hour to make and then my video quality takes like one to two hours and that's what we're posting it and I'm not saying that's a requirement, but like... If you want to get to 30,000 followers, that's what it took daily. I did that. I invested in that before when I had... No following.

Obviously I was able to because I had my agency, but go ahead. Yeah.

Like... I understand you 100%. So I guess the way I look at it as well is I don't necessarily... There's... There's generally two types of content that we can post on social media There's like Twitter repeatable content which can be like our play of the day ladder challenge Stupid stuff like that. That's just repeatable easy that does Repeated and that can be also just like the Instagram story But not actually an Instagram post like maybe a post but I guess like what I'm trying to say is like yes I want to tell the story I want to and I don't I don't necessarily need a a video, a new video per day.

Like, I guess I'd rather Spend the time. I guess okay, whatever we only got one video this week But let's try to get it like we're going for that one viral video like i'd rather try to grow it that way and like rather than just go like If that makes sense, like i'd rather try to find just from us I get what you're saying, but just from a social media perspective like it's not necessary.

It's like That's a hard approach. It's like, because even as like, I've been doing social media, I started my first page when I was 18. I don't even know, like eight years old, I started my Giants fan page. And I've been doing it since then. And like... Yes, I know. I've been working in gambling. I've grown an account to 30,000 followers. But like if you were like, life's on the line tomorrow, like, I need you toI guessI guess like, kind of like, if sorrysorry to interrupt, butNo, you're good.

It kind of just Look it is just like I guess the content, what you mentioned with the story and telling the story really like got, I'd rather focus on like, differentiating in the industry. Like, because we are such a different, like, I don't care if we have to take a different approach to our social media marketing than, like, like, just ad creatives than you might be thinking. Like, honestly, like, I think we can take a super different approach to this than, like, we have, we have a lot of opportunity to, like, actually, like, sell ourselves on when it comes to, like, the story points.

And, like, if we wanted to focus our, engagement around that and just can be like, okay, let's work on three different videos this week that tell our story and see which one does the best. And then, okay, let's, this one got, did the best when it comes to conversions. Let's put a thousand dollars or not a thousand, like let's put a hundred dollars into ads and see what happens. And then kind of like gradually build up, like, if that makes sense.

Yeah, I understand. And There's almost like, from my perspective, like from what I've seen that works, like I almost have two types of strategies actually. And, what you're saying is, does definitely work and I know some people that do it. And I've been, I'm kind of trying to experiment with it as well. But there is like the only difference in why it sucks is because we're embedding and like The betting industry, you have to be super careful with what you say in an ad.

So on Oracle, I have two... I will never boost... I used to a little bit, but I don't boost my Instagram posts. Because in my Instagram posts, usually what's been working really well for me is the sweating video so far. And the title is going to be sports better wins or loses a ton of money. Immediately, I can't run that as an ad because it says sports better on there. I would have to change it to sports picker or something.

That is a pretty simple change and I could probably run it as an ad then. But like... So I guess, yeah, if I just kept that in mind, I guess we could do that. But so with ads... The best way to do it is to have something easy, repeatable, structured, as opposed to like... Which is like the opposite of organic, like organic. Honestly, you want to tell that story and like, It's almost like they're different types of content.

Like an ad... When I'm making an ad, when I see the best results, I just want massive text telling this dude exactly what to do. As soon as he sees this, he knows what he needs to do. Whereas a... story is not like that. I don't want this guy to think I'm selling him. I want this guy to think, "Oh, this is a cool story. How can I get involved? Does that make sense? Why?" The content would be slightly different.

But I still see your point. And even... Yeah, go ahead.

When I, I guess like for ad spend, I guess I'm also considering like non-traditional methods as well. Like I guess, The way I envision is also just boosting the post to let it be seen more by ad spend. Um... I guess just the more eyes on it and I'm not sure the best way to go about it, but one of the things that I was thinking about experimenting-wise is we do also have like... Do you kind of like know how like some social media or not social media like apparel companies do like pre-hype drops.

I guess like, is there anything we could think of? Like, and I guess when it comes to, Like, I guess... I don't want to like... knock on your credibility and like just expertise in the way that ad management because I honestly just have no expertise in that industry but I'm just considering different ways of just approaching social media I guess like if that makes sense because I guess I don't necessarily want to fall into the trap of being the same betting discord and maybe taking a different route because Like...

at the core, and I'll send you this vision statement, Basically, our goal is to help our members gain access to not only the most profitable bets and, like... the best offers that are available to them so they can take advantage of them, but also like the knowledge that it takes to become a profitable better. And like that comes with it. And it's like, I guess like kind of more of a course selling approach like but not necessarily like when it comes to just like the way I think of the relationships between our members, if that makes sense.

Okay.

I get what you're saying, yes. Um, The only thing that I would say that, and I'm not sure if this is the way you're viewing it. It's like the only thing that I would say that is quite important is And a huge difference between us and a course seller would be like, Yes, like we talked about, if we get somebody to sign up for all 20 different books, then maybe it's close to the price of a course seller.

realistically, like, we are not a high ticket business. We can't be getting 10 customers a month. We'll just completely flop. And I know that's not what you, or intending in that regard. But from a social media perspective, I just... And I think the storytelling aspect would be super unique. I don't see any betting discords. Like, I know what betting discourse is doing. The biggest betting, nobody in betting, honestly, for the most part, like, 99% of the people in betting marketing are just trash at marketing.

All they do is just flex how much they win or like, "Oh guys, we're doing the ladder challenge or we're doing the whatever." Even the sweating, I guess it's a little unique. But even that, I've been doing that for years already, the sweating. I used to do with no face. Now I just added a face cam and apparently that's the new thing. You just add a face cam sweat. But like those things, yeah, everybody fucking does that.

But I've never seen someone tell a story. And even these people that have products like Stat AI, dude, they don't fucking do jack. They're like, here's the loading screen on the product of Stat AI. It's not a cool video. Like... the people that I look up to in terms of content and that I think, you know, we could, we could like use as examples would be like, like the people from like, I don't know if you've seen these guys, like the people from like, Lou Lee or the guys from like, I don't know if you know this guy, I think he owns like a retreat or something like Royal Oak Retreat in Virginia.

Like he makes videos about his like development that he's building and like they tell like the story or like this bar in New Jersey, it's called Pitch Social. I've seen it. And I think those guys have mastered the art of content. And sports betting, yes, there's people that get 40,000 views or something per video, the top people. But I think with this product, we could tell a really unique story and...

we can really like change the way like that sports betting is marketed. And I love your focus because it's like, okay, most people, here's their focus, you know? getting whatever getting as many customers as possible just draining them as much as they can and then getting them out that's not what this is about you have an actual profitable strategy that will actually help people mathematically and We just want them to sign up for apps, which is in the strategy that we're providing for them.

So I think that gives us a unique edge and advantage, but I still... I would still say like we still need to pump content. Like the more content you pump. And I know I'm still saying we have to pump high quality content, but we want to pump content here. Go ahead.

I 100% agree with that approach, but I also wanna open your mind to, or like just open the thought of, Because this is also what I would be okay with is if we were to focus on content that was kind of like I guess, low-volume content, but we're focusing highly on the storytelling aspect. I guess, like, just look at it as scratching lottery tickets. Like, I'd rather... I'd rather just... Instead of I'd rather scratch a bunch of lottery tickets.

I'd rather test our luck because I think we are in a really good position and I'd rather test our luck than go for a high amount of like, if that makes sense.

Okay. So what I would recommend then for that strategy is. I would recommend, and again, I guess this is something we could use, like whatever that budget we have or possibly some of the money that I would be investing here. What I would recommend is then... honestly, from the most truthful perspective, truthful perspective possible. Like my... My team is known for just... I mean, they make good quality content, but it's not like the top, like it's not the best you could get.

And like mainly what they do is for scale. Like they're trying to get stuff out daily. And like I said, they're going to have quick turnaround. So that's our approach here. I mean, still, obviously, like we can't have like crazy turnaround.

Let me also open the perspective of I have a lot of just opportunities when it comes to student help on campus. for like those kinds of things. So also just in mind.

What I... This might play into that. What I would recommend then is I recommend we get like... a super high quality editor. That's like somebody that can make like I guess the simplest way to put it, this is going to sound like super expensive, but like... someone that creates these cinematic films, basically. Not an actual film, but somebody who... creates like a story editing. Like even I don't really know how to do that personally.

I've been on social media for a long time, but I think that would be, but I know exactly.

I think I might, I would have an access to a cheaper video editor that would be able to do that. And also fast turnaround if we needed that.

But I guess likeWe give it a try. We rip a series for over a few days or weeks and see how it performs. I mean, it's not hard. You know, you make that investment. You do one video and you see like what type of results, you know, if you get decent results, like if we bring in like two or 3000 views, I think it would be worth because what does the account have right now? Like 300 followers or something?

I guess like the best way I would put it is for this first month, if we only got out like seven videos, But we were just focusing on like understanding and the creation of those videos, like I'll be completely okay with that. Like that would be, we're starting from zero. Like, and I also just want you to just have a, I know that you know what works for your community and I know that it can also work for us, but I also wanna explore the opportunity for like that, Because what I was going for is low CAC high volume.

like I guess the waythe only reason I couldn't Get more volume through my 34 cent cost per click is because it was just an organic link but like I'd rather like focus on if we can get like a lot of If that makes sense.

So in the simplest terms, you... you're really going for the margins here, really. You want to create the mostSlow but steady.

Slow but steady. If we even take three months before we're posting every day, that is completely okay. I have no problems with that.

Okay. Yeah. No, I respect. And I, I, everything you said, I agree. Like I don't, Trust me, I'm not... I don't think this is like... This is different than Oracle PIX. I'm not going to take the same approach. Oracle PIX is way different. Oracle PIX... is about me. Like, it's like... It represents me, what I do, my lifestyle. Like that's, we're not that, you know, like we're not like, It makes no sense to have a video of like, we're not going to...

I do... Some of my biggest videos on Oracle will be me going to Vegas, getting a sick... That just doesn't match with what this brand is. It's like, okay, yeah, we're... I'd say we want to be more like... like a software company as opposed to like, I'm more of a lifestyle brand is what I would say. That's the difference. And I understand that. And trust me, I definitely know. I'm not trying to make it work quick.

The only thing... I would say is, yeah, this will cause some experimentations from an ad perspective. It's not going to be the same thing as Oracle. It will... And obviously I'll be paying for these ads. So we'll, we'll, At first at least until we you know make some money here so we'll we'll do our thing, we'll make sure it works. But it will be like you said, it may take a bit longer because it's not the exact approach.

And it's not even the approach that if I brought in a new client, I would not, you know, this isn't even the approach I would use. This is something that's new, but I know like, I know how to make it work. I have the vision for how it will work. But there will be obviously speed bumps along the way here. We may put a lot of effort into a video that we think is absolutely sick. And then we post it on the internet and it might just flop.

That's just part of the process and it will happen. So I think we're on the same page for that. So I'm excited. I got to hop on with my team in like five minutes here.

So let me keep you for any longer.

Sorry. I feel so good. It's good. I'm excited. I think we talked about a lot of great stuff. So let me, if you could send that doc over to the team, I'm going to work. through everything with them. And, you know, we'll have that meeting. I'll try, I'll keep you in the loop. I got to get everybody's, you know, everybody has different schedules, that type of stuff. So we'll get this next meeting rolling as soon as possible.

And until then, just If anything comes up in the meantime, just message me and let me know.

Sounds great. And I'll just, I'm getting together the docs, so I'll have kind of that base for you to know where Dropout Degens is to kind of like connect the vision where you see the marketing side with the, how the Dropout Degens brand can work. can be like just utilized to be portrayed. And also when it comes to just resources and since it is something that we are new with, if we need those extra resources, like just for example, maybe we need a student or like a UGC creator.

Okay, I can go look for a UGC creator on my campus and that we can see maybe we'll pay him like 20 bucks a video and that would come out of the ad spend. But just like something like that, just, I guess my, my thoughts, my, my words about it would just be, I'm coming from an environment, a college environment, where I'm just experimenting a lot and I don't really care if things don't work. As long as we just Don't spend too much money on them so we can focus on spending money on what works best and producing the best output.

Yeah. And I feel like that, obviously, from my perspective, that makes a lot of sense too. Like, I mean, of course, whatever, dude, if I lose $5,000, at the end of the day, it's $5,000. It's not going to... change anything I do or won't have any impact on what my life is. So that doesn't matter. And I think that's kind of worth the risk here. But like you said, just, you know, making sure every dollar is spent.

And I understand you're probably in a lot different perspective, Blake. For you, probably you would be like, okay, $5,000 will probably, you know, somewhat impact what I'm doing because you're still in college and stuff. So, Obviously, I don't want to just get cooked for $5,000, but at the least, I think... I believe in this idea and I think that you know, this help that I'll be offering can give this another leg.

And I think if we at what we're trying to do and we, both have this vision that I think If we... can successfully do what we're articulating right now I think this will be worth a whole lot more than that with the real community, with everything we have going on. Like I think from an organic perspective, this could be some of the most unique betting content there is out there and some of the best betting content.

there is out there. So I'm very bullish obviously. And let me talk to the team. I'll get them to be just as bullish and we'll, we'll figure things out from there.

Sounds great, and I won't take any more of your time. Just shoot me aI'm gonnaI haven't added your Discord yet, so I'm gonna add it right after we get off this, and then just let me know whatever, um, I'll get over together, like, the documents, but just let me know anything else you would need, like, if it's, um... Anything else? Anything at all, I'll send it over. Perfect.

All right. Sounds good.

Thanks so much for your time. Have a great night.

You as well. You as well. Bye-bye.
