## Overview

Full team vetting meeting with Cayden's leadership — CFO Chris and team member Aria. Dax presents DD's full background, business model, OddsJam agreement, and Real/Porsche's Picks partnership. Chris and Aria ask detailed questions about OddsJam contract terms, equity structure, financials, and long-term vision. Chris flags that the profit-sharing structure may not be enforceable as true equity and recommends legal review. Meeting ends with Cayden's team agreeing to review internally and respond with any contract changes.

## Key Context

- This is a due diligence meeting — Cayden's team is vetting DD before committing

- DD developer (just graduated high school) built all the software

## Outcomes

- Profit-sharing vs. equity distinction raised — contract language flagged for legal review
- Real/Porsche's Picks partnership explained as community acquisition strategy
