# Cayden (Reachpoint Media) — Collaboration Scope — November 2, 2025

---

## Marketing Vision (Dax)

- DD currently has **no marketing** — this partnership is the starting point
- Two types of content needed:
  - **Static/repeatable:** Play of day, ladder challenge, Twitter posts, Instagram stories
  - **Experimental:** Storytelling videos, EV calculator walkthroughs, build-in-public content
- Ad spend philosophy: test with $2K budget, allocate ~$500 to A/B test two storytelling approaches
- Scale spend only after proving conversion rate per content type
- Goal: establish CAC-to-LTV tracking before scaling anything

## Content Differentiation

- DD is a **software company brand**, not a lifestyle brand like Oracle Picks
- Storytelling angle: show how the product works, educate users, differentiate from pick-sellers
- Target content examples:
  - EV calculator walkthrough: tail all recommended bets, show real results
  - Behind-the-scenes: how DD finds profitable bets, how the staff operates
  - Education-focused: "here's why this app is worth signing up for" — not "here's the play"
- No need for daily video volume at launch — quality and story > quantity

## Social Media Scope

- Expand active presence: Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube
- Instagram reels are the priority growth format for new user acquisition
- JP currently handles static posts — Cayden's team to take over and upgrade content quality
- Cayden's agency provides: editors, designers, quick turnaround for sports-timely content
- Potential UGC creator or student editor for cinematic storytelling videos

## Role of Reachpoint in Ongoing Operations

- Cayden manages all external marketing — Dax handles internal Discord operations
- Ad account management, creative production, posting — all under Cayden
- Dax's team continues handling Discord community, staff, and conversion backend
- Shared resource: Dax's staff (JP) available for posting if needed
