## OddsJam Agreement

- DD collects EV bet notifications from OddsJam email alerts
- Verbal, open-ended agreement with Alex Monahan (OddsJam founder) — no signed contract
- Alex gave clearance ~2 years ago; contact maintained on 3–6 month basis
- OddsJam gains: younger market exposure, DD users become future OddsJam customers
- DD gains: unrestricted access to EV notifications and arbitrage alerts
- B2B expansion of OddsJam data: **not currently feasible** — agreement is for internal Discord use only; expanding to B2B would require renegotiation with Alex

## OddsJam Data & Algorithm Development

- DD has collected ~200,000 OddsJam notifications over 2 years
- Sports Data IO used to retroactively verify actual game outcomes against OddsJam's EV scores
- Goal: prove that OddsJam's odds-to-hit probability scores are consistently accurate
- Example: when OddsJam assigns 59.53% hit rate, validate actual hit rate retrospectively
- Long-term plan: build proprietary algorithm off OddsJam data, then approach Alex for formal data access
- Developer (just graduated high school) built all current software; new dev being hired

## Discord Platform Walkthrough (Shown to Team)

- Server welcome bot DM: directs new members to access instructions and partner offers
- Partner promo bot: members claim promos with DD codes, earn free premium access
- Conversion funnel: partner promo → 7 free days → ticket when expired → re-offer next partner
- Invite link tracking: every join attributed to a source link for CAC tracking
- EV channel: live positive expected value bets, powered by OddsJam data

## Financials & Infrastructure

- Actual operating costs: ~$100/month (website hosting, bot, Google Cloud)
- Marketing costs sit inside bonus funds, not fixed OpEx
- No investor funding — bootstrapped
- Revenue comes entirely from partner CPA commissions
- Bank statements and spreadsheets available to share for CFO verification (personal account only — no separate DD LLC bank account yet)
