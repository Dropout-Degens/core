# Cayden (Reachpoint Media) — Business Terms — November 2, 2025

---

## Equity vs. Profit Sharing Clarification

- Chris (CFO) flagged: the structure is **profit sharing, not traditional equity**
- DD's arrangement: IC (independent contractor) agreement, percentage of net profit pool
- Defined as: 20% of total revenue → net profit pool → distributed as "equity stakes"
- Chris noted the contract language may not be legally enforceable as equity — flagged for legal review
- Dax acknowledged and confirmed he has an advisor but will review

## DD Equity Table (As Shared)

| Role | Stake |
|------|-------|
| Kaiden (Head of Community Engagement) | 16% (~20% of net profit) |
| Head developer | 2% |
| Second developer | Unpaid |
| Head mod | Payroll |
| Head analyst | Payroll |
| ~5 analysts | ~10% net profit split (~2% each) |
| Mod giveaway pool | ~2% of net profit |
| Cayden (Reachpoint Media) | TBD in contract |
