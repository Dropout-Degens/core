# Deadshot — Compensation Structure — December 14, 2025

---

## Base Rate

- **7% of the 80% net operational pool**
- DD takes 20% of total revenue off the top to bonus funds (operating expenses + marketing)
- Remaining 80% is the staff-distributable pool
- Deadshot's 7% comes from that 80% pool
- Net effect: ~8.75% of total net profit (7% of 80%)
- Upper cap: **10%** — reachable through performance review after 1-2 months

## Performance Bonus

- Up to **1.5% additional** (bringing total up to ~8.5% of 80%) earned over a 2-month window
- Milestone structure:
  - **50 members with at least one conversion in month 1** → 0.75% bonus
  - **150 members with at least one conversion over 2 months** → full 1.5% bonus
  - Partial performance = proportional bonus
- Bonus is incremental — if month 1 goes well, 0.75% locked in regardless of month 2

## Staff Commission Pool (Attribution Bonus)

- Separate **5% bonus pool** distributed to staff based on attributed conversions
- Each successful conversion earns points — point values tied to partner CPA value
- End of month: staff commission pool split proportionally by points earned
- Acts as additional incentive on top of base percentage

## Equity Note

- Dax verbally committed to **3% ownership** as part of the relationship
- Cannot be included in the IC contract due to single-member LLC structure — no ownership units available
- Will be honored when legal structure allows (potentially after LLC refiling in March)

## Timeline

- **December 2025:** Orientation/trial — no payments, getting familiar with server and partners
- **January 1, 2026:** Commission starts — first payment on or around February 1
- Payment method: Venmo (friends and family) — not W-9 / not tax-reported by DD
