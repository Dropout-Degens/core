## Overview

Initial call with Deadshot, a poker-background creator with 8,500 TikTok followers in the gambling/sports betting demographic. Dax pitches the full DD product and role scope — social media marketing to bring members in, community engagement to keep them, and conversion support in welcome tickets. Deadshot is immediately impressed with what DD has built and agrees to come on. His brother is also potentially interested. Rate agreed at 7% of net with a bonus structure for conversions, starting January.

- Has Telegram contacts from poker (~200-300, ~50 reachable) for cold outreach
- Brother potentially interested in same or adjacent role
- Dax currently at <$1,000/month revenue — slow but expects 5K–10K MRR after pivot
- DD bot spam issue mentioned (invite links getting spammed by bots)

- Rate: 7% of 80% net operational pool, with 10% cap
