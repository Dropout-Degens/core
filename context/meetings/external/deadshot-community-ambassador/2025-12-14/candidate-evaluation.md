# Deadshot — Candidate Evaluation — December 14, 2025

---

## Strengths

- **Social media foundation:** 8,500 TikTok followers in the right demographic — gambling, sports betting, poker overlap
- **Existing network:** ~200-300 Telegram contacts from poker, ~50 actively reachable for personal outreach
- **Daily availability:** Self-employed, phone-accessible throughout the day — can be present in Discord consistently
- **Content creator background:** Already posting, knows how to make engaging gambling content
- **Guerrilla experience:** Has done cold DM outreach for poker conversions — knows the process
- **Impressed with DD's build:** Authentic enthusiasm for the product after the pitch — not just transactional
- **Collaborative:** Immediately offered ideas (newsletter, storytelling content, weekly recap) — adds value in the conversation
- **Brother as pipeline:** Potential to double capacity with a trusted referral

## Weaknesses / Concerns

- **New to sports betting:** Poker background, not deeply familiar with EV, sportsbooks, partner terminology
- **Learning curve on conversions:** Will need time before he can meaningfully help members in tickets
- **Social media in a new market:** TikTok following is poker-focused — pivot to sports betting content requires experimenting
- **Revenue is currently very low:** <$1K/month means commission earnings minimal at start; retention risk if slow start

## Fit Assessment

- Well-suited for the hybrid social/engagement role as scoped
- Best use of his skills in Phase 1: top-of-funnel via social media and cold outreach
- Phase 2 value grows as he learns the product and partner ecosystem
- Commission structure appropriately calibrated — no salary risk while he ramps up

## Decision

- **Hired as community ambassador**
- December = trial/orientation, no payment
- January 1 = official start, commission begins
- Brother to be revisited once Deadshot is fully onboarded
