# Deadshot — Role Definition — December 14, 2025

---

## Role: Community Ambassador

- **Scope:** Full user journey — find the user, bring them into the server, help them integrate, drive first conversion
- Not an analyst or mod in the traditional sense — a hybrid social/engagement/sales role
- Primary focus evolves over time:
  - Phase 1 (January): Social media marketing, getting familiar with the server and partners
  - Phase 2 (as he learns): Community engagement, answering questions, supporting conversions in welcome tickets

## Social Media Marketing

- Leverage existing 8,500-follower TikTok (gambling/poker demographic) for DD content
- Create sports betting content using DD brand — use the DD assets, EV tool, partner promos
- Content approach: show what DD tools do, post bet slips with codes, behind-the-scenes usage
- Can help build up additional accounts with his knowledge of social media growth
- Guerrilla marketing: cold DMs in other Discord servers (sports betting communities, Real Sports, etc.)
- Telegram outreach: ~50 reachable contacts from poker days for personal conversions

## Community Engagement

- Be present and active in the server during the day (self-employed = phone availability)
- Engage in conversations, welcome new members, respond to questions in public channels
- Support welcome tickets: when a member from his invite link joins, be tagged and handle their ticket
- Help members understand which tools and partners are relevant to them

## Conversion Role

- Help members claim partner promos via the partner promo bot
- Attribute conversions: screenshot + partner name submitted in attribution channel
- Conversions from his invite link members attributed to him even if another staff handles the ticket
- Goal: get members to their first partner conversion → free premium access → ongoing engagement

## Brother's Potential Role

- Brother is open to either community engagement or social media marketing
- Similar self-employment situation — phone-accessible during the day
- To be assessed after Deadshot settles in — no commitment made yet
