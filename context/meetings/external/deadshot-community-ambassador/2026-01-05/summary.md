# Deadshot — Onboarding Call — January 5, 2026

**Type:** Recruiting/Hiring — Onboarding Session
**Participants:** Dax, Deadshot

---

## Overview

Follow-up onboarding call to get Deadshot set up before his official January start. Dax walks through the promobot, invite link tracking, EV system, arbitrage, partner pages, and contract. FliffEV was just pushed live a few hours before the call. Contract sent for e-sign. Deadshot confirms his approach: social media marketing and guerrilla outreach first, community engagement and conversions as he learns the product. Key technical setup partially completed (staff role linked via Discord had SSL error on dropoutdegens.com — to be fixed).

## Key Context

- FliffEV launched same day as this call — filters live for Fliff channel
- Contract dated January 6, sent for e-signature
- Deadshot is 21, in New Jersey — can access legal sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, etc.)
- DD website (dropoutdegens.com) was down during call — SSL handshake failure blocked linked role setup
- Deadshot confirmed: not familiar with most of DD's partner apps (only knows Underdog)
- Guerrilla marketing plan discussed: cold DMs in betting Discords, potentially paying $3 to boost DraftKings server for visibility
- Deadshot encouraged to put DD invite link in Discord bio

## Outcomes

- Deadshot fully briefed on DD systems, partner ecosystem, conversion flow
- Assigned personal invite link — will be tagged when his members join
- Attribution: his link members credited to him even if another staff converts them
- Contract sent — to be signed
- Partner advantages document to be drafted and sent
- List of target Discord servers for guerrilla marketing to be compiled and sent
- Fliff EV live — shown to Deadshot as new flagship feature
- Tool access (OddsJam, Arbitrage): hold 1-2 more weeks before granting
