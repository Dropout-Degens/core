# Deadshot — Role Definition — January 5, 2026

---

## Role Confirmed: Social Media + Community Engagement + Conversions

- Phased approach: start with social media and guerrilla marketing, add conversion skills as he learns

## Phase 1: Marketing (Immediate)

- Social media: TikTok content around DD's brand and tools, growing presence in sports betting market
- Guerrilla marketing: join betting Discords, participate, build relationships, refer members to DD
- Cold outreach: poker Telegram contacts, anyone in his existing network who might convert
- Discord bio: DD invite link in profile so any server he's in has passive visibility
- Boost experiment: $3 to boost DraftKings Discord profile for 3 days — test if organic link gets clicks
- Server tag: adopt DD server tag so every message he sends anywhere shows DD affiliation

## Phase 2: Engagement + Conversions (As He Learns)

- Engage in DD public channels — be a visible, helpful presence for new members
- Handle welcome tickets: when his link members join, get tagged and introduce himself
- Help members understand partners and tools as his knowledge deepens
- Submit conversion attribution: screenshot + partner name in mod channel

## Attribution Logic

- Deadshot gets an invite link — all joins through that link are his members
- If his link member converts (even if handled by another staff), **still attributed to Deadshot**
- If Deadshot is the one who also converts them in the ticket → potential double points (TBD)
- Tag setup: Dax will tag Deadshot in the welcome channel whenever a member joins via his link

## Content Resources Provided

- DD brand and assets available for social media use
- Partner pages accessible in server to understand each partner
- Partner advantages document to be sent — explains value prop of each app
- FliffEV channel just launched — good content opportunity (show live EV bets)
- Access to company accounts (OddsJam, Arbitrage): granted in 1-2 weeks after he's more familiar
