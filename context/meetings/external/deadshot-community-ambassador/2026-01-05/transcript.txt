Kind of basically what I was thinking.

I don't know if you're thinking mainly, if not all, like social media marketing to... Bring in the people or how else you would? recommend on it if you have any like I don't know. I'd say advice of how you got people in the past. I know you said you acquired a bunch of servers and stuff like that, but... Yeah, no, I mean, like, it's something that like, I think I could do, like, I would just obviously have to learn a little bit more about it.

Like you said, to like, get get down a little bit more with the lingo and how everything works with the whole sports betting. But I think it's definitely something I could, I could figure out and make work over the next few months.

Awesome, awesome, yeah. And that sounds good. And I guess, like, on my side, probably just a little, just didn't have all my documents in a row. And we also had that, like, two-week period that we were maybe kind of supposed to use to, like, just start getting, like, acquainted that we didn't use. So it was kind of just, like, if we were to start on the first with that, it would be a very, like, weird situation.

And I get you 100%.

Be acquiring another server and then I'm also bringing back a couple more staff members that'll be active and help on that end so basically like when it comes to getting members, I guess like if you Think social media is the best way to do it Then you can feel free to use the job of DJ's brand and I'm just not very good at creating social media content at all But yeah, I can help you when it comes to like the aspect but also like I don't know how but I'm sure you have like a bunch of guys that you could text But and those would probably be good conversions you because you might have a personal relationship from like I'm getting together a list of discords to just mill around in and see if we can get members.

It's kind of a weird process of just making sure we can do it without getting banned and it being a large amount of server that they don't care.

Yeah, no, I've been a part of that. A huge thing in poker, too, is joining poker discords, trying to poach people. It's the game.

I would just call it guerrilla marketing. Yeah, no, 100%.

Yeah. But I guess also then the aspect of when you bring members into the server, I'm almost done detailing the documents.

I'm like 99% or I would say 90% done. But we just need to flip EV. And also, have I shared? I probably haven't shared the vision in... Let me find that and then send that to you in chat real quick. um But this is our overall vision, mission, and roadmap. Um, Alright, this is not the right one. Okay. You don't have to read it all right now, but this is just like the positioning we're trying to be is we're just trying to bring them value effect and bring this in the document more is by like by pivoting to the education centered mission and we can just drive our offers to be like, you should use this resource because this is the value you will get from them.

And so what we are going to do, and this is going to be like, What's that actually going to work? Yeah, we're gonna make individualized tickets for all the members who join So it's really just gonna be a personalized experience So what? I missed it. I You get tagged when anybody from your link joins. I'll give you your own invite link here. Also, let me just pull the screenshot because that would be easier.

Am I gonna be on like your TV for your Xbox?

I got a headset on, so you can...

That's so funny, though, that you're doing the Hexbox for display.

Oh, wait, are you sharing your screen? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, wait, yeah, no, literally, yeah, no, you're on my monitor right now, hold on. Alright, perfect. Let's load in. Hold on. See if it works.

I kind of forgot where I was at. Oh yeah, so when members join... So what we do right now is we are currently I just made all these so they don't have any joins yet, but we are basically going to put all these in our database and track where all of our users are from. I'm going to give you one of these so you'll get your own. Anybody that you invite off this link, I can have just I can have you be tagged in the channel.

Let me see where it is. It's in our...

Audit log.

I get a message like this right now. But I can basically tag you every time a ticket is created for a member that you bring into the server. And that would help you actually when it comes to helping convert the member. But basically just... And then when it comes to tools to convert, I'm still gonna change a little bit more of the documentation to be like, This is the... This is like the value that you're getting from these users.

And then I'm also gonna get a document together. This is every single one of our partners. For example, this is Fliff. You should use Fliff because it has the advantages of the daily dollar. And you can just play with that and collect the free daily dollar if your play misses. And then, for example, our partner Onyx have the advantages of just like same game parlays and actually has profit boosts, which none of the other social sports books have.

So like I'll get a document together, like detailing all the advantages of why you should use site XYZ. And then I think I might have already showed you this, but the partner promo bot, of course, of just like this will be in the channel. I don't know if I'm going to have it send in the ticket, but it'll be like very accessible in the message. So they'll just be like, oh, okay, we'll get their information.

And hopefully we can try to get them on one of our partners immediately because then we will just give them free premium access so they can actually experience the value that they're getting. the drive to convert right away. when it comes to that one user, I even if our other staff are the ones that, for example, take a free access ticket in the future, since they are from your invite link, I will still attribute that to you.

So like if they convert and. Um, like they need to convert on like flip for example and they'll also be able to mark it as claimed so this was possibly just going to be auto populated by users because what we might do is just have them claim it here and when they do this it pops up something for the mods to confirm then they just claim all access all like this through the button here, and it would be a whole interaction and it would be tracked and super easy.

And that's the goal. And so basically that would allow you to get those three points for that user or one point for that user or five points for that user. Gotcha. And then... We also, this needs to be updated a little bit, but we just have like a couple other bots that you can just give them as, hey, these are the resources channels, like check out these channels when you come in to help you take advantage and value in the server.

SoActually, yes.

Ideally for me, if I'm like, Basically, like especially just social media marketing to bring people in. I think like As I like learn more about it, like, honestly, the guys you have running the community management side of it may be better at converting once they're actually in because they just are more familiar with it. But then obviously, like once I start to get more familiar with not even just the server, but also just kind of sports betting in general, I can definitely help convert people to.

Exactly. Awesome. So like even help like engage in the, in the.

like channel and like the chats too like yeah i think that even helps to learn more about it and just like kind of get a better feel of all of it yeah and i mean do you bet yourself Yeah, but like not much.

Just like kind of like if I'm with my fellas watching some football games, we'll throw some out.

What state are you in?

New Jersey.

Oh, that's ass.

Yeah. I mean, I'm 21, so you can just use all the legal books.

We don't have it until like January or February, but... gotcha let me see what we actually have but basically like I'd also like if you did any of our partners I'd give you the credit for the points um that they are oh word um Let me find-where I work in FNHC-ah, here it is. Let's see what we got in here.

And I know like so many things are... Our band in Jersey.

I think you have to put us in Jersey for Onyx. I think Because my friend was in Jersey, I was trying to convert him and he couldn't because he was 18. But if you're 19, you can in Jersey or it might just not be a jersey.

You know, I haven't even heard of, like, any... I heard of Underdog, but the other five I have not heard of.

Yeah. Awesome. But, like, basically, just wait to... Just wait to convert on these for now.

Yeah, no. Yeah, no, 100%. I'm in no rush to.

But, like, we can also, like, just do the things. And also, like, one of the big things is just, like... Since you've never heard of these what really helps is sending pictures of the app like sending screenshots of your slip because people are like, oh, what? Yeah, it's X. Yeah use the dropouts code. And right there, that's easy. Yeah, that's valid. And it's like, it's not even a date. want free access it's more of a they want to investigate and they'll probably be using our code too um yeah so that's a huge advantage we have and like our partners page we have a lot in here and i'm actually trying to i'm gonna try to expand it um which is probably going to be a lot but um we're just going to basically the way we want to position it as is each of these is you don't necessarily want to use all of them but you want to have them in your arsenal because of the specific And again, like I'll get that, I need to get that document together probably on the sooner side.

And it's not even in my roadmap doc, but I'll make a note to get that document and over to you. But basically these are just all of our partners.

So like, even if you're not familiar with them, just, referencing them and or even this page is even like converting myself and just like getting a look at them and like even using them for a little bit just to like understand it better for like helping either one kind of Like... specialized social media posts towards some of them or like Also, just like especially when converting, like obviously knowing how they work.

Exactly. Also, so one thing that I can do for you. So you are 21 and you are in New Jersey. So let me I have a company account for this. Like, one thing also, another thing about our partners, I have a company account here, here, um, nah. I had one at Outlier, I will get that back. Um, but I have basically three of these, um, and I don't, I haven't yet given out the login for Odds Jam or Daily Grind Fantasy, but, like, Arbitrage is such, like, a big, educated, better thing, and so is EV.

Um, but, like, if that's things you wanted to post on your social media, I would 100% give you access, um, to these tools, because they are kind of expensive, um, Thank you. And also the way we look at our tools is one, we have integrations to help. We just launched FliffyV, so nothing's in here yet, but we literally just pushed this, a couple hours ago um but we've got um filters live for flippy v so some of these picks whatever the good ones are um will be sent out in this flip channel and then eventually the same thing will happen for all these related channels as well um But basically, this is like kind of like the integrations of, hey, use these tools to get familiar with the concept and then you can actually convert and use the bigger tools when you actually have the best role and your time for it.

And then another thing I'll kind of touch on the premium aspect is Because we have so many partners and then integrations and like this will be live and this will be a huge part of why we are switching to $50 per month. But basically like the aspect of $50 per month, I don't really want to charge anybody that because I think it's extremely high, but I do think it kind of matches the value that we bring as a server.

So I want to give as much free premium as possible through our partnerships. I also kind of like vision wise, I never wanted to raise our prices. I raised them to 25 a while ago and then I dropped them back to 15. But I never wanted to raise our prices. But the only reason I think it's very valid to raise our prices here because of the not only like the it'll just raise the value of the server um like hugely so like you'll easily see if like the thing you're if like the package is worth it because if you're given the free promos when people get in once they i'm assuming they expire after a certain amount of time you'll see if people are buying it or not and if they're not then maybe you have to bring it down but definitely don't undershoot yourself at the start yeah like the biggest thing like we want to do is like we want to just like come from the aspect of we don't want to charge you that much for a pick.

It's more of just use our partnerships and we'll give you free access. And so also this is Arbitrage. And so are you familiar with Arbitrage? somewhat it's like it's basically like betting on two books and like finding profit in between them yeah so you bet the over and the under at a specific amount and you'll make a certain amount of money no matter what so with this one if you bet the over 27 and a half in the first second half total points um it's plus 240 here uh you put 43 bucks on it um it pays like if you win this loses you lose your hundred dollars but it pays um 43 at you 240, which is a profit of like two bucks.

But if it, but either way, you either make two bucks or like three bucks.

So like you risk $143 and make like two or $3. So it's like 2% value. So that's kind of like how arbitrage works. And it's, it's very, my dad did it and you can get banned, but he did, I don't actually think you can if you do it right. But he literally only did arbitrage.

But if you mix it into your regular betting, I don't think it's that big of a thing. But I would warn you of getting banned on it if you do arbitrage, but if you mix it into just your regular... He didn't bet at all.

The only bets he did was arbitrage. Yeah, exactly. If you hop on a new account and just start arbitrage betting over and over. But if it's an account that's been betting and doing other... you're not going to get.

Yep, exactly. Probably.

Yeah. Or at least it'll take a really long time for you to. Yeah.

Like, and he still lasted like a year and got like, I think he made five or 10,000 out of it, which was pretty good.

That's sick. Yeah. And you get good bonuses too, from just like arbitration, the free money. so basically, yeah, I definitely, if you wanted to check it out. Yeah. No, like stuff like that.

Like, I mean, I don't know exactly how I would put it into social media, but like, I feel like promoting that aspect of it like could be just something that definitely gets people in and trying to convert if you can like give them arbitrage bets because like obviously not everyone has this you said it's pretty expensive right yeah arbitrage yeah arbitrage is the higher end um so like there's also positive ev which isn't as like confident to get money so like the way positive ev works is like has their own algorithm on calculating the like the outcome of the event so for example they think this is going to happen okay this makes sense so they think this is going to happen at 41 and a half or 41 percent um but the odds are plus 170 which means you almost get double your money for it so like it makes sense to bet it um even though you might not win every single one in the long run it makes sense to bet yeah like it's saying you have like a four four point two percentage there if they're like numbers are right that makes sense yep and so basically the way that by looking at when they're actually right with their positive EV projections.

Like we have a system for like when, I don't know, I don't have the data open right now. No, I don't have it open. But basically, we can-maybe I do.

Aha. Um. We can see when... They have... I didn't want to commit that.

We can put filters into the data. When the bet size is between $500 and the odds are between here, they get a pretty solid win rate. I believe this market was at 80%, and then this one was at 70% and 100%. They're looking pretty solid. Hopefully, we just don't get high variance, but these will be one of the bigger aspects of the positive EV that we'll push. I'm going to clear these channels out because these are just, they used to be really good.

Like our hockey way, way back before we got everything in here.

doing that.

I think we had like an eight game one streak for these at one point. And the thing with these, with the hockey, especially is we were trying to get it at like one to two minutes. . End.

What's the point?

And that's kind of our approach with the EV, and that'll be a good offering for our members as well. And it'll be a good converting point for our partners as well, because it has our partner code.

Oh, shit. Yeah, that's sick. No, but I feel like also just like everything you guys are doing, I feel like most like handicappers, they're not really like, they don't have the data or like, I mean, they like say they have the data behind it, but like most of the time they're just giving fucking picks they like.

Exactly, yeah.

You guys are actually showing like why there's expected value on the picks you're giving, which is like, I feel like a huge seller.

Yep, and we're trying to, we don't do a very good job marketing it, which is why we're trying to, we're in an education pivot. education information first. So like this, you know, I think that's smart.

And we're going to bring all of this to the front and it's just gonna be a big push of like your, I need to actually update our server tag to say like, I don't know.

Let's just, I should write that. Let me just go to... Ciao.

Like, place every bet smarter, empowering sports bettors with access to the tools, resources, and knowledge they need to take advantage and find profitable markets seamlessly integrated into our Discord community. Like, I think that's, like, a really good way to explain it. Like, just, like, we want to empower sports bettors with everything they need. Like, and we do that through our resources and partners and integrations.

And so I guess like... I guess that covers most of the things I wanted to go over on getting you set up with. And then on my side, I also have to get... Um, contract um for you like i don't have i guess like the contract's more like Um... Vanity more than anything like Well, no, it's legally enforceable, but we don't really do anything because we don't also give you a W-9. So you're technically an independent contractor, but we're not going to tax you.

You're going to get paid through Venmo, so it's friends and family. So technically... the contract is there but like it's not in you have to pay taxes on this job aspect yeah i gotcha I can bring that up real quick to review.

Um.

It's just our blanket contract It hasn't been updated since June, so it's a little while ago, but I'll have to update this, but basically we'll be referencing what is in our document and then also just like what we talked about of the bringing members in however you can and doing your best to help them find value with our resources when they're initially onboarded and letting our staff take over from there.

Gotcha. And then independent contractor status, that Basically, seven days notice for termination of the agreement. If you need anything, this is the contact for us, our legal address and our email. And then just we do have a confidentiality clause. Just make sure you don't share it if you have any access to financials or like. Anything secretive, please don't share that. Intellectual property just basically says, for example, if you send a message in the Discord, that's our data and it's our intellectual property.

We may do something with that. And then also just the aspect of like... our data itself being in our property. This is just standard for a contract protection on my end if there's anything. You can't sue us for that much. and Pennsylvania and then I'll update basically the work services to have your information and the payment information is just going to be first of the month I get the numbers done.

I didn't do a good job on it. Like the last month, it was a few days late, but every single month, I get the numbers done on the first of the month and also getting it automated this month. So it's gonna be easy, but basically the numbers on the first of the month and we'll aim to pay you on the first of the month and just in a contract up to 14 days and then you can take action. And then this will be deleted from, this is just for our analysts, butThank you.

That's basically it. Sounds good?

Thank you. Let me double check my agenda to see if I have anything else.

But yeah, no, just on my point for getting, like trying to get new people in, I think definitely like... I have a TikTok page, definitely, but it obviously hasn't been running in a while. I've tried to post some other stuff on it and it hasn't really taken off right away. I think there will just be a bit of a learning curve, especially in a new market, too, getting content rolling. I think also in that time, if there are opportunities for me to...

kind of brute force my way into some, into getting some people in, like you were saying, and other servers or anything other like that. Been pretty successful, like, doing that myself and other, and, like, poker. Just, uh, kind of basically like even cold DMing people and just like talking to them about it. So like any spots where like that's a possibility, I can definitely do that too. I'm also like trying to kind of get over the curve of getting into a new market on social media.

Definitely.

I will, like, I have it on my, like, I just don't have it organized. I'm not the right thing. So many servers that I'm in and a bunch of them are good for all the things. I just have to get a good list together and definitely I will let you do as much guerrilla marketing as you want. Bet. Maybe I'll have you spend... Or I'll pay you to spend three bucks to boost the DraftKings server. It's kind of random.

But, like, if... If you keep your Discord profile online at all times, or at any point, if it's there, just link to the Dropout Dgen server. I don't actually know if this is a good source, but it's three bucks to boost a server, and it's worth trying out.

Yeah, no, that's actually not a bad... Not a bad thought. I know that was a thing.

If so, if you threw your link, the DropoutDegens link in your profile bio, and then just like...

Yeah, I have no need to do anything with my Discord bio, so I'll put whatever you need in there. I'll change the name if I can. I don't use Discord too much, but obviously I will now.

I will get you... I'm not gonna send it to you now because I have to check which one I sent the other guys because I don't have it written down properly. I need to do that.

But I will send you one of these invite links. So it'll track basically just every single member in your server and then like, or not in the server. Yeah, every single member you make in the server. And just like actually everything they do. I'll go on one more tangent because we have in the betting tip server, we have this. I should use a partner program. on data stored to the user. And then this is like, we get their state and we get their age data from that, which is pretty good.

And then we get like how much they get, we have their bankroll from this. So like, it's really good when they use our like little tools. We're also gonna build a couple more just to like, whatever, like, Also, like, kind of the aspect of helping you learn. Like, if you ask me questions, that is amazing, like, because I can, like, see what would value you and, like, see if we can build that tool to, like, bring value to more people.

So, yeah. Definitely feel free to text me about anything education-wise on that aspect as well. Wait, I feel like I was supposed to answer you on something.

I forget. Nothing that I can think of.

I think... Yeah, I think, like, there might be, like, a couple more things that I could go through in here, but, like, it's mostly, like, I think if you explore it on your own and then just shoot me over a question as, like, it goes.

Yeah, no, 100%, I'll be around. I'm gonna obviously go through everything, honestly try to start, like, Just like even if not posting or like making content myself, just kind of searching around. just like sports betting, social media, Try to get some ideas and also just like honestly if you want to At some point, no rush, but just... Send me over some servers that I could join, check out what they've got going on, uh...

Start to try to message some people, anything like that.

Yeah, I will write that down right now. I will send you over some servers and I'll also send you like the partners doc for like these are the information of how to get value from these partners that we have. And then also one, another thing that you can do is if you actually go to the server and adopt the tag, every single message you send anywhere will have the tag. And I'm just trying to like encourage more people to get it.

Gotcha. Just so like, If they're typing in any other server, it's there. And actually, we need to pay for it again. I need to write that down.

I need to actually do that. Basically like... It's...

It's a good... marketing tactic as like anybody who clicks on it is a good user.

Where's that at? I'm on the server right now.

It might look different for me because I'm not but you just click on our server name somewhere and there should be a tag or if you click on like any of my messages where I have the tag you might be able to adopt it in the server.

Yep, got it.

Awesome.

Um, did I get it? Let me double check. Let me check if we have the staff role applied. Okay, not yet.

Can I have you log in through your Discord here?

Are you sure I just adopted the tag?

I think you did. Yeah, you did. It's a very different thing. So I got my Discord up.

Did I get a first shot? Nope.

Might need a minute for me to try to remember my Discord password.

You're getting always. but this is like this is just a vanity role so like anytime you type in our server it'll show you as a staff so like you'll have be more reputable so like when you're actually trying to convert on our partners it'll be a little hopefully easier to you because You'll be marked as a staff. And also, I haven't seen-actually, this is a really, really old system. It's so depreciated off Discord.

I don't think they have much built for it right now. But it's something that our dev put in this place for trying to do with our all access a while ago. And it never worked, so we just gave it to the staff. But I've never seen another Discord with it, so I think it gives us a little credibility.

I know I had two Discord... I wonder if this is logging me into a different one. Uh-oh.

Let's see.

If I join it and it's like not the right account will it tell you that? I think you did it right. Now, write one. Uh... Let me.

And if you can collect Link to all Actually, I can just pull it off on my stream. That's kind of stupid. But basically... Just clicked authorize... Huh? There's a link to roles button where you if you click on that server name, there's a link to all button You can click on that and then you can select staff and it should give you it Under linked roles, right?

Yeah. Whenever I uh, it says SSL handshake failed.

Oh, our website might be down there. Thank you.

Yeah, I think this is hosted on dropoutdjens.com.

Yeah, that's definitely us. He did not fix our world.

It's all good. I can do it another time. There's no big rush on that.

I'll get that fixed. That's a... When that's fixed, you'll have this staff role and then you'll be able to look a little more reputable.

Yeah, a little more clean and people actually know I'm somebody, not just some random dickhead.

Yeah, exactly. And then the thing I mentioned with the tagging and how I'll tag you in these channels, I'll have to... I know it's all developmentally possible, but I don't know how our timeline is looking because I haven't pitched it to our head dev yet. And he's the one that builds all this but the For at least this server welcome you will get a tag for all the members who join in here But when it comes to the free access the way I'm going to do it is basically like if a specific Person converts them in that ticket for example.

I'll just use me as an example I think I might exclude myself from the staff bonus But yeah, I'm definitely excluding myself from the staff bonus. So I'm gonna use like like onboard somebody and get some free access they were your user you guys will both get the points for that Gotcha. So you'll just get the extra kick and then he'll get the thing as well. So and then if you're the one that will convert them, then let me let me get back to you if it'll be double points.

I might I might give you a bonus of that. So, I mean, I'll have to do the math and then I'll let you know if you'll get double points for every one you convert, because that might be a good way to do it. And then the last thing I want to... Sorry, there's like a little bit of a tangent. The last thing was... I wanted to write in the contract, instead of this third section, I'm going to write in just a clause for you to get an extra percentage.

Actually...

Let me see. Um... Actually...

So, we're going to do that. Okay, yeah. I'll also explain this. So legally, I only have a single member LLC. So I'm going to have to look at what in, I think it's March when I refile. But basically, I don't have any ownership units. So there's one ownership unit, and it's me, basically. So I can't give anything that counts as equity. So I actually don't have it in the contract right now. But the 3% that you get is, I will 100% honor that.

Yeah, no, 100%. I wanted to, and even if I don't write this in, I would like to get this in. But I would like to, like, if... set a goal for the first month. Like for example, I don't know. How many users do you think would be a good number of new members of the server?

Like converted to or just new members in general?

So I guess like we can either go the route of like new members, no conversions considered, or we can go the members route of conversions only, or we can go the route of just like number of members with at least one conversion.

Got you. Yeah, I mean, like, honestly, any number I throw out there, I'd probably just be shooting straight in the dark. You'd probably even have a better guess than I would, especially without, like, knowing how social media could go. You know how social media is. It could be a month of... barely any views and then one post pops the fuck off and gets millions of views and gets 50 conversions from it.

You know what I mean? Not conversions, but 50 people in the server. So like, and then like also, I don't know how well if you've tried to brute forcing goes and kind of like you said, guerrilla warfaring places, but yeah, If that goes well, that could also get a ton of members, but I just obviously have no knowledge of. how that will work.

You know what I mean? No, I get that. I get that. I guess like, um, also like from, I think like one of the big points would be from like your network of pre convert, like, I guess you tell me about how that works. Like, how did you have the interaction with the people that you converted to the poker group?

Yeah, I'd basically just... I'd have a... like a link in my TikTok bio that could also, I could put that in probably like a, I could even put my specific invite link in the, uh, bio But there we would just send him to a Telegram channel. And from there, I'd have my like at in there and they just DM me basically. And I just talk to them from there and get them in.

Okay, awesome. So like you have the personal relationships.

Oh yeah, no, 100%. Even now, I even am chat support for another guy's poker. I deal with people all day that are... probably way more annoying and rude and just like dickheads than you deal with on a daily basis trying to get people into this server.

How many people would you say is in that network? Um...

And like the one I'm working in chat support for or the one I had with my poker?

Yeah, the one. How many people would you say that you have like that open DM or like you go into your telegram and say, oh, yeah, hey, by the way.

Yeah, probably like...

The thing is, a lot of them made Telegram, played, and then deleted Telegram. So like... There's probably like 200 or 300 contacts, but how many of those are... able to be actually contacted, maybe 50. Yeah. Because I've obviously went back in through and tried to reconvert players that stopped playing, but a lot of people just make a telegram and then either delete it or just delete the app.

Yeah, there's no reason to use the telegram. It's like poker.

Exactly, or more nefarious things.

Yeah, exactly. I get that. I guess probably... I guess... I think-I want to say like a hundred members converted at least once or if you wanted to do 300 members into the server or like just I guess like... 125 conversions as a blank number. Those are three separate things, by the way. Yeah. Like, the three separate routes of going. Like, I guess, like, those are the rough kind of numbers I was thinking.

Yeah. Got you. for that extra bonus percent. I guess, what are your thoughts on that?

Yeah, no, I think that's reasonable. Obviously, I'd need to see how it starts going over the first month or two and... Kind of see how well... any of the things I'm doing and like if I can figure out some new things to make it go even better but like I don't think that's unreasonable to reach for I guess like or we could if you wanted if you think it'll take you like a little bit of an adjustment period and you wanted to extend it like for more than a month I'd be open to that Yeah, no, I think it would be because I just obviously have no idea how...

it's gonna go and i'm sure there is gonna be like when i was doing the poker too like it was there's a good probably four or five six weeks that i was kind of just like learning everything and getting the curve of it and then shit started to pop off and i probably got 150, 200 conversions.

Yeah. Okay. Awesome. I think, okay. So I think if we do it over, let's do it over two months and then I can give you up to a percent and a half. So instead of being three, you could be up to four and a half. And then this will allow me to evaluate. And basically like if we are basically halfway of that goal, I can just give you half of it. And then that way, if you, the second month is slow because it just doesn't kick off that well.

And the first month was good. Then we'll just keep that seven, that low. 75% not 75% .75% I get what you're saying yeah and I guess as a goal let's just say um I guess like, what would you rather go? Members that converted once, like total members?

I'd say members that converted once probably because like that's that's what we're looking for like obviously members in the is good but you're looking for we're all looking for conversions Okay. I feel like that's the best way to really provide value, you know what I mean?

I guess I think for a good number for that So, if we did 150 total members converted once, and if you were able to get 50 of those 150 in the first month, then I would give you that 0.75%. If you are able to get that full 150, then I'll give you that full 1.5%. Yeah.

Does that sound good?

Yeah nah, sounds good.

Okay, awesome. So...

What I need to update is since this won't be in your contract it will be in your job description so I will update the job description to include your this percentage and this bonusUm. Then I will also, along with the other document, and the servers. Yeah, shut up. And then the contract Since it's already the sixth, Send it over tonight. Just send it over back tomorrow.

And then we're all good on that.

Sorry, could you say that again? You kind of cut out for a second.

For the contract. I'm just going to date it for the 6th, if that's good, which is just today. If you're able to... It should just be an e sign to send back Gotcha. And then anything else, any questions, anything you think you need to get set up?

Not at the moment. Probably will have something to shoot over you when I start actually getting into it. But at the moment, nothing that I could think of. All right, sounds good. Yeah, like you said, even on the education side, I'll definitely just like anything that I even have somewhat of a question about, I'll chew over your way just to... Kind of pick your brain.

Awesome. Sounds good. And when I send over the invite link, I'll have to see when I will roadmap that for like actually getting you tagged. If the welcome ticket's easy and I can do it, I'll get that updated as soon as possible. If not, I have a fix that I can really do really easily. I can just change one of these roles, the head staff role. I can just change that to just a random role and give that to you.

And then because it tags the head staff role and you'll just get tagged that way. I'll make sure it once you get members and from the welcome to get Sounds good. Awesome. I'll send that all over. I'll get started working on it tonight and I'll get it off, send it over tonight and should be all set. Gotcha.

Looking forward to it.

Awesome. Just hit me up with any questions. When it comes to the resources like Odds Jam, let's just give it another week or two to actually get you a little acclimated. And then if you think you'll use that tool, I'd definitely be more than happy to give you access.

That sounds good.

Awesome. All right. We'll, we'll talk soon.

Yes, sir. Have a good one, man.

You too. Bye-bye. You too. Bye-bye.
