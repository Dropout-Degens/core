# Deadshot — Candidate Evaluation — January 5, 2026

---

## Assessment Post-Onboarding Call

- Deadshot is engaged, curious, and asking the right questions about how to contribute
- Honest about being new to sports betting — not overselling his current knowledge
- Proactively learning: said he'll browse sports betting social media content, research what's working
- Shows initiative: asked for target Discord servers, wants to start guerrilla marketing ASAP

## Adjusted Expectations

- Phase 1 focus confirmed: social media and guerrilla marketing — not yet converting in tickets
- Realistic about TikTok curve: new market, will take time to find what works with the sports betting audience
- His existing poker audience is the warmest leads — Telegram outreach is the fastest path to early conversions
- Acknowledged that in-server conversions will take more time as he learns the product

## Concerns Identified

- Still unfamiliar with most DD partners — partner doc is critical before he can have meaningful conversations
