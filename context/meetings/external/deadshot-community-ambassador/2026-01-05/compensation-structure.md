# Deadshot — Compensation Structure — January 5, 2026

---

## Finalized Terms (As of January 5)

- **Base rate:** 7% of 80% net operational pool
- **Bonus:** Up to 1.5% additional over 2-month window (full bonus at 150 conversions with at least one partner each)
- **3% equity** verbally committed — cannot be in contract due to single-member LLC structure, honored when legal structure allows

## Contract Details

- IC (independent contractor) agreement — not an employee, no W-9 issued
- Payment via Venmo (friends and family) — not tax-reported by DD
- **7-day notice** required for termination by either party
- Payment schedule: numbers finalized on the **1st of each month**, paid within **14 days**
- Dax working on automating payment calculation — previously a few days late, improving

## Contract Clauses Reviewed

- **Confidentiality:** Don't share financials, proprietary data, or any sensitive information
- **Intellectual property:** Messages and content created in DD's Discord belong to DD
- **No equity in contract:** Single-member LLC only has one ownership unit — can't split until refiled
- Legal jurisdiction: Pennsylvania
- Termination: 7-day notice, then agreement ends

## Staff Commission Pool

- Separate attribution bonus pool: 5% allotment split proportionally by conversion points
- Point values tied to partner CPA — higher CPA partners = more points
- All staff who made attributions that month share the pool
- Dax may implement double points if Deadshot is both the inviter AND the converter

## Attribution Mechanics

- Deadshot submits in mod channel: partner name (text) + screenshot of successful conversion
- Dax runs end-of-month count and distributes accordingly
- Members from Deadshot's invite link attributed to him even if he didn't personally convert them
