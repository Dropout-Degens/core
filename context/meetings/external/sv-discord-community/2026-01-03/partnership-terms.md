---

## Status

- All terms from December 13 meeting remain open — no new terms discussed or agreed to
- SV has not made a decision on the merger as of this call
- Decision pending SV's assessment of his own time availability and server direction

## Key Constraint Identified

- SV's current primary commitment is the "Spooky Tag" video game project
  - 4v1 asymmetrical horror game (Dead by Daylight-style), Unreal Engine, publishing to Steam
  - Alpha releasing within approximately one week of January 3
  - SV is under NDA — limited detail sharing
  - The game project is paying well and consuming most of SV's bandwidth
- Discord server direction undecided partially because SV doesn't know if he has time to run it

## Staffing Consideration (Reiterated)

- SV confirmed he has a solid team and does not want to leave them without positions
- Dax confirmed paid staff roles available for SV's team if merger proceeds
- This remains a key factor in SV's decision
