# SV (Discord Community) — Follow-Up Call — January 3, 2026

**Type:** Community Partnership/Acquisition
**Participants:** Dax, SV

---

## Overview

Short follow-up call — both sides giving quick updates. SV has not made a decision on the merger yet and is still weighing his options. His main competing priority is a video game side project ("Spooky Tag") that is demanding significant time and paying him well. The call was cut short when SV's game project collaborator messaged to hop on an urgent call. No meaningful progress on merger decision.

## Key Context

- SV is working on a horror video game "Spooky Tag" (4v1 asymmetrical horror, Unreal Engine, published to Steam)
- Alpha releasing within a week of this call — very time-crunched
- Game project is under NDA — can't share details
- Game is paying SV well and is explicitly his top priority right now
- DD is not in a position to compete with that time commitment
- Dax's update: spent the time since last meeting onboarding staff, still validating EV filters

## Outcomes

- No merger decision made — SV still undecided
- Call ended abruptly due to SV's game project obligations
- Agreed to reconnect — either same evening or following day
- SV reiterated he's not dismissing DD — just genuinely time-constrained
