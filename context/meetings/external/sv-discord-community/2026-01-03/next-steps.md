# SV (Discord Community) — Next Steps — January 3, 2026

---

## SV

- [ ] Finish current urgent call with Spooky Tag project collaborator
- [ ] Reconnect with Dax (same evening or next day) to continue the conversation
- [ ] Make decision on merger direction once game alpha ships and time pressure eases
- [ ] Communicate server direction and staff intentions to Dax when ready

## Dax

- [ ] Wait for SV to reconnect — call was cut short, SV committed to following up
- [ ] Continue EV filter validation — share update when filters go live
- [ ] Hold merger terms as previously discussed — no changes needed until SV decides
- [ ] Follow up lightly if SV goes silent for more than a week post-alpha launch

## Open Items

- Merger decision: still pending, SV genuinely undecided
- Game alpha timeline: within ~1 week of January 3 — decision window opens after that
- All terms from December 13 remain on the table unchanged

## Follow-Up

- SV committed to calling back the same evening or the next day (January 3 or 4)
- If that call happens: resume discussion on merger, staff specifics, and member migration
- If no follow-up: check in after Spooky Tag alpha is out
