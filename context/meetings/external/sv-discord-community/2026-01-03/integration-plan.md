# SV (Discord Community) — Integration Plan — January 3, 2026

---

## Status

- No integration steps initiated — merger decision still pending
- Dax shared quick update on DD progress since December 13 meeting

## DD Progress Since Last Meeting

- Staff onboarding completed — Dax spent December getting the team structured
- EV filters: still in validation phase — waiting for more data to verify accuracy before going live
- No other major integration-relevant developments to share before call was cut short

## SV's Current Priorities

- **Top priority:** Spooky Tag video game alpha release (within ~1 week of Jan 3)
- **Secondary:** DD merger decision — genuinely interested but doesn't have decision bandwidth
- Server direction: SV debating whether he even has time to continue running it independently

## Planned Follow-Up Integration Discussion

If SV decides to proceed after the video game alpha ships:
- Full integration meeting needed
- Topics: staff roles and pay, capper accommodations, member migration, channel structure, lifetime member handling

## Timeline Expectation

- No hard timeline — SV will reach out when game pressure eases
- SV expressed intent to reconnect same evening or next day to finish the conversation
- Practical decision window: likely after Spooky Tag alpha launches and stabilizes
