I respect that. It's good to be here.

It's crazy, man. Yeah, I have so many side hustles that I do, man. So it's like... I'm always constantly doing something.

Yeah, I feel that and I love that because I feel like maybe I can help to possibly take something off your plate in the future depending on how things go and all.

No, yeah, for sure. I'm still thinking about what direction I want to do with the server. I haven't fully decided yet as far as that goes, just to be honest with you. I know that you said that you've been implementing a couple different things in your server and stuff too, which is pretty cool.

some more data elsewise, but I'm just waiting on a little more data to verify our filters before we put them in. But we're looking really good on just like that aspect. And I guess like to, let's just set a quick little just like agenda. I guess what would be the best added outcome of this meeting for you? Just to like context and information wise.

I was just kind of just touching base with you to see like an update as to like where you guys were at with your plans and stuff like that. And then I was giving you like a little bit of like a touch, like a little bit of an update as to where my head was at and like where I was like, where my vision is with my own server and stuff. You know, because we've been trying... Yeah, that's about it. I mean, and then like, so as far as like, okay, because like, I do have like, like I said, like, I mean, I do have like a pretty good, like a solid team that I've like put together and stuff too.

You said that you also have like positions that you can potentially give them and stuff. If I were to like merge over to your server, right?

Yeah, I definitely would have staff spaces and like they would be paid roles as well.

You said what? I'm sorry.

They would be paid for as well.

Pay drills as well. Perfect. Okay, cool. I just wanted to make sure, because I don't want to completely screw over my staff and stuff like that as well. Because I know they all worked really hard on trying to get the servers together. So my thing is, I'm debating if I have the time to run the server or not, which currently I really don't, between my actual job and my side hustle kicking off. Because I'm in the midst of building a video game actually.

So that's my side project that I'm working on. That's super cool. What is the video game on? What kind of genre will it be? It's a horror video game. It's going to be published to Steam. So it's going to be like, it's being coded in Unreal Engine right now. So basically, it's kind of like a horror game. It's like a 4v1 asymmetrical horror game, similar to the game Dead by Daylight, but it's not exactly it.

It's called Spooky Tag. That's what the creator-we'll list the guy who's back in the project, the guy who's funding the project. That's what he wants. He wanted it to be called. Um... I can't give you too much details because I'm under anything non-disclosure agreements, so unfortunately I can't give you too much details about it.

That sounds sick.

That's awesome. Yeah, there's going to be an alpha coming out here in the next... The alpha's going to be out within the next week. Oh, shit.

That's coming up really fast.

Yeah, that's why I was like, it's like time crunch right now. So I've been like, I've had like several late nights, uh, trying to work on that project.

I'm for sure. I'm for sure. Um, like. So like, does that... You'll probably get a good, does that bring good revenue from Steam? I'm not really familiar with how that market works. Yeah. That's fine. Okay, so I think on my side let me pull up a screen share all I still need to like bit with the context and the content in our roadmap but I will Pulled that up now. But basically from when we last talked till now, I spent a good deal of that time onboarding the staff, just getting a good overall...

I'm so sorry, but the gentleman, the other dude who I'm working with on this project is messaging me and wanting to call. Do you mind if I call you back?

Yeah, no worries. We can hop on in a little bit.

Okay, I can call you back either tonight or I can call you tomorrow, whichever one is better for you.

Sorry. No worries, no worries.

I'll see how long this takes and then we can go from there if you want to do that.

Yeah, just shoot me a text whenever you're done. If it's too late, then we'll call tomorrow and if not, we'll pick it back up.

Yeah. Yeah, my bad, man. My bad. This other project is paying me a lot of money, so that's why I prioritize it over Discord stuff. Not to be disrespectful or anything like that. It's just that project's paying me a lot. A lot of money.

No, I'm sure we're pretty small-time. No worries at all. We can call it here.

No, but I'll definitely... That's why I'm definitely going to make some time for you. We'll finish off this conversation here in a little bit, okay? That's why I'm definitely going to make some time for you. We'll finish off this conversation here in a little bit, okay? Alright, sounds good. Talk soon. Bye.
