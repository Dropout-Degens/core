like how to like actually like you know bankroll management etc because that's something and then like your affiliate links are definitely something that's um Also... You know, also something that's intriguing as well. Yeah, I think overall that's really good.

Yeah, to touch more on our affiliate links, I need to recalculate, but I believe it's like $12.50 or around that mark that we can get. And then it's also just... It is greater than that since we get paid on a recurring schedule from our tools partnerships because they are monthly subscriptions. So we basically get a portion of that. But basically, when I turn 21, our LTV will unlock to be just adding all of the sportsbooks, for example, FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM, Caesars, just all of those affiliate links as well into the arsenal.

And those pay a lot better than the social sportsbooks and just... DFS affiliates.

Yeah, that's definitely... Something that I was going to suggest as well. Because I know that FanDuel and DraftKings, they have a way better payout than compared to your DFS apps. So I'm glad that you're going down, like you're trying to go down that route is what I'm trying to say.

Yeah, I have been exploring it, but it's, I think...

It's not the easiest way to...

this one outsource company because FanDuel and you can get these links through just a couple of different sub-affiliate sources. So when it opens up and when my age gets there, I won't really have that block anymore. So that'll be just very positive on our side. And I guess like talking about the roadmap. So we're not really blocked by the 21 plus apps opening up conversion wise.

Yeah, because you're not using it necessarily.

Yeah. Yeah. invite links are actually giving us the best converting users and then focus on welcome tickets with them and so that'll just be able to just get an individual like one-on-one chat with our team to them to one get the first conversion and then to get them acclimated to the server and then the next thing we'll have for conversions will be our partner promo bot that'll just be in the Our partners channel will have I think I showed you partially it but once Like, it's not fully completed yet, and I have a developer.

I'm in college, so I have another college student, which kind of sucks at it right now, doing things.

I can help with, like, development as well, too, because I do know how to do, like... Um a variety of different programming languages and stuff as well. So if you need assistance with that, I can definitely help. I also do a full-time job, so it's like... Yep, I get that. So it just may not be instantaneous instantaneously, but we can definitely set timelines aside and we can definitely talk about when you want things done.

And then I can get done by like this, but like X date, I can give you an estimated time frame as to when like X project would be done.

Awesome.

That is something that I can definitely help you out with. Like I know a lot about like just a variety of different languages and stuff. I also have colleagues and stuff. to a team that'll help me if I need to. Yeah, if you need anything, just let me know. My team does stay very busy, though, because we don't work on just single projects. We have other projects that we do work on as well. I have a couple guys working on a website for a hosting company right now.

They're working on that. I have about four or five guys that work with me. Thank you.

Okay, that's awesome. That's really awesome. So like, I'll tangent a little bit for our development status. So yeah, basically, I have two developers on staff, or technically three, one of them doesn't hasn't done anything in about a year and a half, but he he's like four and, and he was just good for a couple good things. But he he doesn't do stuff for us anymore. But then I have our head developer, which is he's actually younger than me.

But he is currently doesn't have the time to do stuff for us anymore. To work on any of our projects. But he. Basically set up and did. All of our infrastructure. And just absolutely everything. When it comes to our bot website. Did like discord integrations. And he handled everything. When it comes to that. But he just he got a job that. I think he's like working 55 hours a week. Making frying pans or something like stupid shit.

So he's just not working anymore. So I got this new. I have a friend that offered some help. But it's kind of its final season for us, so he hasn't, like, done anything yet. So, like, once he actually starts doing stuff, I'll be able to actually understand, like, what he can do. And then I also have, like, Claude code and stuff. So, like, I'm not, like, we're not, like, theoretically that far blocked, but, like, we just do need a bunch of stuff to happen developmentally before we can really focus on just, like, the...

marketing and getting the members in for the conversions.

Yeah, I feel like also just based off what I'm hearing, and this is just my opinion, With getting rid of people who are inactive and stuff, I feel like that needs to happen as part of your revamp. Um... Yeah, like you said you have a developer who's been there for a year and a half and hasn't done anything. So I mean, like, therefore, like, I mean, he clearly has gotten or they've clearly gotten Yeah, I have a couple of depreciated members that basically are still on staff. I haven't called back on them yet because they've gotten busy over the years, but I'm going to eventually at a point call back on them. And if they're not going to be able to be available, they're going to be moved. And that'll be by the end of the year.

That's somewhere in that timeline for that. Hold on one second. I'm sorry. I have to excuse myself for just a minute. I apologize. No worries.

I haven't called back upon yet. But... You guys try to reach back out to them before just letting them go Correct.

Yep, and that kind of is gonna lead into my next point. So basically when it comes to Kind of like the staff depreciation. So when it comes like the way that I've Previously like kept the community active is through two acquisitions. Basically I acquired servers like yours. But two of them made up my basically most active community base for about a year and a half, or a little less than a year. But one of them actually just ended up quitting doing sports betting in general.

So his community just fizzled out. And then the other one left and just went to do his own Discord, unfortunately. Left with a bunch of his community members. So our community is a little bit on the less active side so really I'm just don't really care about our current community engagement and I'm focusing on getting these systems in place so that we can actually capture on this conversion revenue before we start on our engagement and re-engagement.

Perfect.

That makes sense.

So like our community is like our community base right now is really inactive, but it's not worth the effort to keep them active and or get them active and to keep them active. to really and then in the time that Thank you. That effort could be put towards conversion metrics, and if I just wait, it would be more effective then, if that makes sense.

No, for sure. That makes 100% sense. And... I definitely... I definitely couldn't agree.

Okay, awesome. So I guess like, let me pull back up my notes. So with the the next things with our vision is kind of about our. So once we get our conversion metrics in place, we do need a little bit of our community reengagement. So once we get because we want members that do join through our marketing to not have just no community to come to. But once we do, we want to have a community that is able to come to our have those two in place we are going to begin our just marketing campaigns and so when it comes to marketing we typically have paid about 35 cents per customer or 35 yeah 35 cents per join through just organic methods and that is our server link being posted on This board those and such and then just also we have the if you google flip discord Are I have that discord server?

It's called flip flops first thing that pops up is the official flip discord our official discord link and it takes you to that discord which takes you to our discord and so that was a really popping Just organic source for us for a while. It's a little bit fizzled down now since flip is just like established But we're going to be able to just begin meta. And so when we when it comes to meta, we paid about One dollar and I think it was about a dollar 25 per conversion And we didn't really focus on meta ads because it was just expensive and we couldn't convert at The time, and this is about a year, year and a half ago, and when I say convert, it was on our partnerships mostly.

We couldn't get them to convert on more than one. But now with our, with just the systems that we've learned and are going to be putting in place, we'll be able to just pass on the information. pay either more for customers or just acquire more customers at a higher rate because we just need if we spend $100 we just need to get if it's a dollar per customer we just need to convert on two people to get all those other 98 people to be basically free and any conversions on them is pure profit if that makes sense Yeah, no, for sure.

Like we'll have really good margins is basically what and we'll have like a lot of Like leeway to experiment on these margins. So when it comes to advertising and the scale of advertising, we're going to try to stay in the dollar to 250 range per customer. Um, just subscription price. Uh, we're currently $15 a month and I'm planning to, I don't think it'll be by, uh, 2026. Um, but in. By mid-February, we will have our prices to about $50 per month.

That will also help with our partnership conversions since we give free access for a conversion on our partner. Okay.

That makes sense. I like that. I like that vision and I like that timeline and time. And then like that... The timeline that you put into place as well.

Yeah, thank you. And then there's one more thing. I can actually show you this if you want. Sure. Um, this is kind of, it's actually really bad, but, um, basically, it's a funnel, um, Thank you. This is what our onboarding or our funnel will look like or kind of looks like. So right now we have just all of our acquisition sources, but they all lead to somebody joining the Discord. And once they join, we really just understand mostly their join method.

Okay, so you're trying to use like ad network to basically advertise your Discord.

Yes, we'll have a number of places that will be listed in. Okay. But basically, We're going to be So exploring the join method basically is we're going to be just testing all of these individually and differently to see which one leads to better conversions. So like we'll keep our spend pretty low until we find something that has the best conversion rate and then spend all of our money there. that's like kind of the goal with this so we learn who this person is and like where they came from and so they get a message sent to them let me see if I actually have this Let's see.

from TikTok. I actually have one of these. Let me pull this up. Sorry, this is like... Hmm. Basically it'll tag us saying Ticket was created for user, for everybody who joins. It'll look something like that. And then we will have basically when it comes to what we learn about people, we have a. Um, Calculate unit size bot. So we basically know people's, we'll understand people's bankroll, like how much is your bankroll.

Um. yeah so people will give us that information Um. And then we'll also know like When it comes to Where is it? We'll also know their state. Oh yeah, we're going to put the partner promo bot in this channel. But we'll know their state through the partner promo bot and that will allow us to serve them like state. Just state...

Like basically like automated.

Yeah.

Like automated, like automations is what you're trying to do.

Yep. We're going to do a lot of that based on... if they are And then-This is the bot I was talking about. You can change your jurisdiction. We do have a few Canadian members, so we just leave Canada as a second option. But like... basically get down to the state of people where they live.

Okay, this is interesting.

And-We... Let's see, do I have any details on-Ah. We'll get to go in and like... When they claim it, it just links with our link as well.

So that way they know what's available in their state pretty much in a way.

Exactly. And like what offers actually like. What matters to them and what they get. Yep. Because some people don't like scrolling through this. So we wanted to make it a little bit easier. And then in this listing, we're also going to just have it be. So our. Our highest earning partners are going to be first. This isn't set up right now, but it will be set up so our highest grossing partners will be just the first ones they can see.

And then we also have weekly rewards. People don't use this that much right now, but we're also changing it. But people can claim a... I should have showed you the chances. But you basically just get a random reward. And you get a coupon for your month of all access. But we're changing these all to be more with our Karma system. So we actually built a Karma system. Do you use real sports at all?

Do I use what I'm sorry real sports Oh, really? Yeah, I do.

Yeah, they have a karma system, so we took inspiration from that, and we built out our own karma system. So basically every message you send and you karma and then reacting and then also you can wager it in our daily poll and So... JP hasn't been covering this in a while, but... They, you can just bet on the pool. Um, and then... We have a leaderboard currently. Our bots always going to be first because it sends out over like easy messages.

And then this is actually the big thing of what's coming next. We have our outlier insights. Okay.

Yeah, Outlier. Yeah, Outlier is cool.

Allies, amazing. These are like, the insights they send just aren't that good. But again, it's like we recommend just...

using our link for... Yeah, outlier insights are not bad. They're just... Yeah. I use PickFinder myself, but... If they... But outliers.

So, when it comes... We haven't expanded our partnerships in a while because we just have some money now and we don't want to get more and then just not convert for them. So, we've... Oh, I paused. Because, like, Optimal built a whole EV integration for our Discord. Well, I actually told them not to, but... the I actually told them to build it. But well, funny story is they asked me what my members would use.

And I said they would probably use EV or arbitrage, if anything. And they're like, OK, so we build you an EV bot. I was like, well, we already have our own EV bot, which is this. But they built us an EV bot anyways, and it didn't convert for them. So they shut it off for us. But we can get other tools integrated in the Discord. It is not hard at all.

Yeah.

But this is the big thing for us. So what we'll have also is when this actually starts getting used more because it's all just like in the backlog or just not live yet. This will just you'll be able to say that you place this bet. So I placed two units on this. No It's got a 1. And then it actually takes you into your own thread. Um...

and you actually Oh, she basically can track it right there.

Yep. And I can actually report this as a win. And so now my That will be-Better.

Oh, that's interesting.

Yeah. So we haven't done much with this, but it is something that we'll have. We'll have like... Um. like basically bets flipbook will just be all the bets they had and we'll just be able to go through them but we're gonna be building out stuff like that I have a let me see I have like a an NAN integration that tracks my picks set up sometimes. But basically we're doing a lot with the just Um. We're going all in on building out these tools and kind of just trying to make it more of like that community feel and less of just the, hey, I'm just here to get picks.

And actually just not only build the things that make people want to stick around, but also just the things that will also help us convert. Gotcha. So do you have any questions so far?

I don't. I think that that's actually a lot of useful information. So now what I'm going to do is just... take everything into consideration and see what what route I want to go with my server and stuff. Um, I'm thinking like, cause like as far as like the merger goes and everything like that, um, I just need to think on that for a minute and I just need to... Because I know which route, how your servers are going to go and what your plans are for your server and stuff.

Now I just need to see how it aligns with what my current members' needs are and what they're expecting and stuff as well. If that makes sense.

Yeah, that makes complete sense. Do you mind running me through a little bit about your server?

Yeah, so we basically just drop plays. We have cappers in our servers who drop plays for our members and stuff using statistics and stuff. I have my own like models that I coded through like chat GBT and stuff that I have. that predict basically like outcomes through like probability. I can show you.

That would be very interesting because we have data that I'm actually working with right now.

So like, for instance... Sorry, my computer's like lagging. No worries. There you go. So do you see what I mean? So right over here, this is a hockey model that I coded and stuff. So basically what it says is, but like San Jose at Pittsburgh, for instance. So it predicts the goalies, saves the save percentages for each goalie that's running and stuff. Sidney Crosby's Snipers to Watch. Basically, it's people who are high shooters, high, basically, anytime goal threats and stuff.

So this is the projections based off of like, so Laskin, he got six shots on goal, 21 plus minutes. So that's a green light usage for Macklin. So basically, and then down at the bottom, it just says this is the simulation it uses. So it's simulating Sidney Crosby to get Four shots on goal, one goal, one assist, 20 minutes and 40 seconds for the time on ice. Excuse me. And then basically, so I use this data and stuff.

great plays and stuff because then I based it then I cross-reference it with pick finders data and then I look at the different statistics if they're playing away if they're playing at home and all of that good stuff but it usually like it usually does really well That's really interesting.

So I guess like what data do you use for your model?

So basically I have, I have it pulling from a bunch of different websites and stuff. So like, like pretty much like anywhere from like ESPN to like every hockey website that you know. Yeah, so basically, like, I'll show you right now. So, like, there's a game coming up tonight. Let me check real quick which one it is. It's the... I like Kings. Thank you. Sorry, let me see. No, no, so there's a... Okay, so let's say the Predator is an avalanche.

So... for that. So they're about to come up in play. So basically what it does is it goes into-it's using the 5.2 thinking model.

So basically what it is, it's simulating it. So it uses like daily face off, money puck team stats. You see, so it's pulling from all these different websites. It takes it some time to pull all the information because it's running about 10,000 different simulations as to how the outcome could go.

So with our EV data, we get it straight from OddsJam. So like... Yes, you have a ton.

So here's this right here. It already just pulled it. Oh, wow. So then it predicts like, okay, cool. So close. So Kale Maker is going to have 25 minutes time of ice. Okay. Or a time on ice. And then four shots on goal. et cetera, et cetera. So for instance, I did a lotto slip today.

And it went...

Let's see. Let me look at the results real quick. It went three and three so like three out of so I had six plays on it and it went three 50% pretty much.

It's not bad. And it was only hooks. It wasn't off by much. So yeah, it wasn't like-only one player was completely off. He was 2 out of 3.5.

But everything else was hooks. I'll send you the screenshot.

So if you look at our chat right here It was just off by 0.5 on both of those two, and then Crow was the only one who was completely off. He needed two more.

I think he had a goal, too. How did he not get there in half tonight? What'd you say? I think he had a goal tonight. How did he not get three and a half?

I know, that's what I'm saying. That's what's crazy. He had a goal. He did not get three and a half.

He should have gotten three and a half. It was like, the stats were there.

That's crazy.

Yeah, that's how accurate it is though. So it's usually anywhere from like 50 to 70%.

That's pretty solid. I'm working through my data right now. Here, I'll show you this. Basically with our OddsJam messages here, I will...

Let me stop sharing.

So we've been getting these odds jam notifications in this form For... Actually, forever. So like-Basically, we get them as an email. Um... and So... We just parse these emails and send them as Discord notifications. Um... But they give us basically all the event information and their odds to hit rating. And so what their odds to hit rating is basically like they have their own algorithms that they run.

And they just say, basically, I think this event is going to hit at 60%. And so every time they think it's going to hit at 60%, they give it a 54.14% odds to hit rating. that data and say, oh, so when they actually give it this rating, we They actually hit at 70% or 80%, so we can just filter out the future notifications so that we only look at the ones that are hitting 80%, 85%. Gotcha. So it was taking us a while because we didn't have it was we have like about 200,000 or probably 250,000 of these individual events.

And so like we actually had to go into the box score and figure out the outcome for each of these events. So that wasn't like very easy to do with everything. But I eventually got access to sports data. through just which is like big boy data through my internship. So we are we have about 200,000 of these events that are just that we're looking through right now to start to build filters out.

Okay, that's really cool.

Yeah, so we... See? So basically like all of these It is just sitting in one of our tables. And then... We were actually able to figure out the actual score for the market which gives us the the win or loss and we have about, I forget, we have 166,000 of these. So I'm looking through them currently. But we've also got, I'm also giving the data over to somebody at Syracuse who's going to look at it and then potentially build us an algorithm based on it.

So that's hopefully going to be done. I don't actually think he's going to be able to build a successful algorithm, but he'll look at it by the end of the year. But our filters should be live sometime this month. That's good, that's a good thing Yeah, so this is, we'll be banking on this a lot. So kind of like, So we don't have to rely on the analyst base as much. So not only will we have the analyst picks, but they'll just be supplemented with this constant feed of EV bets.

I'm trying to keep it to, like, if I were to release it with the filters currently, they would probably be sending, like, still 50 notifications in each channel per day, which is too many. So I'm still working on cutting it down. But like the ultimate goal is to have like 6 to 10 in each of our, for example, Football, basketball, hockey channels every day. And they'll be hopefully just 80 to 90% winners when they do come out.

Okay, that's cool.

Yeah, it'll be a good service hopefully. This will be kind of like also a big backing for our prices going up to $50 per month. It'll be a good justification to supplement just the analyst picks as well.

Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. That makes sense.

With your server, how many members do you have in it?

We have nearly 600 members in our server right now.

And it's still free, right? For your premium?

Yeah, it's still free.

How many members do you have in that?

You said how many what? I'm sorry.

How many members do you have in your free premium?

So currently, let me check. So we have 300 members in our free premium. That's pretty solid.

Yeah. Did, and I know you have like a payment option. Do a lot of them pay or no?

Some of them do, some of them don't.

Some of them have paid, some of them haven't. And I have a record of all of that as well. Of the people who did pay and stuff.

So for the, I guess like, do you have any, like with your server plans, I guess, Do you have plans to... Make that paid and do you think it would go well?

That was my initial goals like to get in my server to a certain point to where I can start charging people for plays and stuff.

As of right now, I'm just keeping it free because I don't have the...

I don't have the member count that I want to where it justifies it to be a paid server. And I also don't have the... The, um... What's it called? ♪ The, uh... Oh my gosh, I just lost my train of thought. I also am trying to grow based off of our success rate and stuff like that. So I just want the statistics and stuff to match. So then that way we can base that.

We can use it as a leverage to be like, oh yeah, we're cashing you guys out pretty much daily. Therefore, it justifies the $10 a month for people.

Yep, that makes sense. So just consistency?

And you're thinking of charging around $10?

Yeah, just around $10 a month. Nothing super big.

Yeah, your members would probably convert well still on that.

Yeah, like if I'm cashing you out $100 a day, $100 plus.

Yeah, it's hard to make a big... I would love to hear you say $50 or $25, but it's hard to make that jump when you're initially...

Yeah, I don't want to.

And I start small anyway. Like, I would just start small and then I would slowly increase.

Yeah, that makes sense. How many staff members do you have?

So Staff Wars, I have... Let's see. I keep my team pretty small, so I have... In my actual staff members, I have one developer who works with me, which he's on my team. And then I have three... three or four admins and then two moderators or three moderators but uh one of the mods i don't get to remove he doesn't even like do anything really he's just kind of like hangs out Do your admins do they send pics?

Yeah, they do. Void does... Rabbit doesn't. Rabbit does more development stuff, I ask him to.

Mini will send pics and community and then MiniTank sends pics as well. Thank you.

That's not bad. That's a solid spread.

yeah and then I have cappers and stuff as well who are dedicated to just sending pics how many of those do you have I have I have nine of them.

Wow, that's actually, that's a solid, where'd you get nine?

Just because people who I know and just being in the community and stuff, man.

Okay, that makes sense. So there were previous... Tell me more about how you got started with your server.

So it started out as just like a friend's discord, just like me and a bunch of friends just hanging out and stuff.

And then it started turning into something bigger.

Like, it was just like, we were just kind of, we came over here from a different server because they're, they, so there's, there was a leak server where they, they leaked a bunch of, uh, people's plays and stuff and they had a chat in that server but this owner of the server shut down the chat because people were bitching too much just to be real and so we came over to this server over here and we ended up um It's chilling over here.

Then this ended up growing into something bigger than what it-It was intentionally. I remember the days where I had 20 members in this server. And then over the last few months, I've just grown it to like, you know, five, six hundred just by like just networking with people. And then I have a collab coming up on Monday with a bigger capper as well. And he has like over like six thousand people in his server.

And these collabs you run, how do they work for you? Or like, how do you frame them?

So I just framed them on Twitter and stuff, so basically, like, we, um... We post it on Twitter, and typically you tag and just repost and then quote the tweet and stuff as well for each other.

That way they get...

they get coverage and then Hi, then you get coverage as well. So...

That makes sense, yeah. Yeah.

Um, Go ahead.

of your server and then if a merger is just a feasible option then we should just talk then.

Yeah, I think so too. That's what I agree. I think that's how I'm going to think about everything. And then I took some notes and stuff over here, so I'm going to think about it, go over my notes, and then I'm going to make a decision based off of that. the entirety of the situation. Because, you know, I also don't want to screw my members over either. Or that I want them to feel like they're getting screwed, I guess.

If that makes sense. Definitely understand. And also for...

Just like same thing with...

Go ahead. safe acquisition deal we would give them like yeah whatever for coming over and then the one thing i do want to do is like there is a few people who paid for lifetime my server it's not very many it's like literally like three or four people i just want them to keep that yeah if that's i would be able to grant you like at least five lifetime passes um and those would even like if when we do change to fifty dollars everybody who has a lifetime would still be included and then uh who's like on our current price would keep that current price and not have to pay unless they cancelled but I would definitely be able to give you lifetime for some of your members and then for your analysts since I don't have like the room to pay theoretically nine if something like that did happen we would also have to talk about some special cases for other members of teams to make sure that they are included Okay, perfect.

Sorry, I was writing everything down. Alright, cool. Alright, I gotta get off here right now.

I will connect with you here in the next couple days, and then we'll go from there.

Sounds good, no worries. Take your time.

Hey, it's a pleasure talking, man.

Thank you so much for showing me everything, and thank you for going over your server and how you foresee it in the future and stuff, man. I'm looking forward to work. Awesome.

No problem at all.

It sounds great and looking forward to it as well.

Hit me back whenever you've had some time to think it over.

For sure, bro. I'll hit you up. All right. Later, man.

Thank you.

You too. Bye-bye
