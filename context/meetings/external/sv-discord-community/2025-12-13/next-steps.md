# SV (Discord Community) — Next Steps — December 13, 2025

---

## SV

- [ ] Review notes from meeting and think over merger direction
- [ ] Assess how DD's model aligns with what his members expect
- [ ] Reach out to Dax in next couple of days with decision or further questions
- [ ] Consider staff situation — which of his team he wants to bring over or protect

## Dax

- [ ] Wait for SV to reach back out — don't pressure; let him decide on his timeline
- [ ] Prepare acquisition offer details if SV decides to proceed (lifetime passes, staff role specifics)
- [ ] Consider how to handle SV's 9 cappers if merger moves forward
- [ ] Explore potential for SV's hockey model + DD's EV data collaboration regardless of merger outcome

## Open Items

- SV's decision on merger — timeline unclear, estimated "next couple days"
- Staff role specifics and pay not yet discussed — needs dedicated conversation if merger proceeds
- SV's cappers: 9 is too many to absorb as paid staff immediately — needs case-by-case plan
- SV's Twitter collab network: potential partnership regardless of full merger

## Follow-Up

- SV will reach out when he has a decision
- If no response in a week, light check-in appropriate
- If merger proceeds: full integration plan meeting needed covering staff, member migration, and channel structure
