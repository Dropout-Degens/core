# SV (Discord Community) — Initial Partnership Meeting — December 13, 2025

**Type:** Community Partnership/Acquisition
**Participants:** Dax, SV
**SV's Community:** ~600-member Discord, 300 in free premium, hockey-focused with cappers

---

## Overview

First meeting with SV, who owns a ~600-member Discord server. Dax pitches the full DD product — EV system, promobot, conversion funnel, pricing roadmap, karma system — and SV reciprocates by showing his hockey AI prediction model. Both sides leave intrigued. SV is open to a merger but wants time to think it over and assess how the DD model aligns with his members' needs and expectations. No decision made.

## Key Context

- SV's server started as a friend group, grew organically to ~600 through networking and Twitter collabs
- Server is free; SV considering charging $10/month eventually when stats justify it
- Has 9 cappers, 3-4 admins, 2-3 mods, 1 developer (Rabbit), staff positions are active
- Has a few paying lifetime members (3-4 people) he wants to protect
- Uses a custom hockey AI model: 10,000 simulations, pulls from Daily Face Off, MoneyPuck, ESPN
- Collaboration coming Monday with a ~6,000-member server
- SV also knows some programming — offered to help with development if needed
- DD's community is currently inactive — Dax acknowledged this honestly

## Outcomes

- SV fully informed on DD's systems, roadmap, and conversion model
- SV's server and model explained to Dax — mutual understanding established
- Merger not ruled out — SV needs a few days to think and review notes
- Key merger terms previewed: lifetime access for SV's paying members, paid staff roles for SV's team
- Dax to follow up and let SV reach out when ready
