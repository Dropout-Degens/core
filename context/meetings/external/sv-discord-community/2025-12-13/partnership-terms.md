# SV (Discord Community) — Partnership Terms — December 13, 2025

---

## Proposed Merger Structure

- SV's community (~600 members, 300 premium) migrates into DD Discord
- SV joins as staff — role TBD based on further discussion
- SV's existing staff team given paid roles within DD's staff structure
- SV's cappers/analysts: special case discussions needed — DD can't absorb 9 paid cappers immediately

## Member Protections

- **Lifetime members:** SV has 3-4 paying lifetime members — Dax to grant them lifetime access in DD
  - Lifetime access maintained even when DD raises pricing to $50/month
  - Any existing paying members keep their current rate unless they cancel (no forced upgrades)
- **Analyst/capper staff:** To be handled case-by-case — can't guarantee all 9 slots but willing to discuss

## DD Partnership Offer Details

- SV's members join DD as their permanent community home
- Access to DD's EV system, partner promo bot, ticket system, and all partner offers
- Free partner access for members (DD earns CPA revenue — members don't need to pay)
- CAC targeting: $1.00–$2.50 range per join

## SV's Server Comparison Points

- SV's server: free, $10/month future target, caps/picks-focused, 9 cappers
- DD: education-first, EV-driven, no picks dependency, going to $50/month, CPA revenue model
- DD's community is currently inactive — honest acknowledgment made
- Difference in business model: DD doesn't want members paying — wants partner conversions

## Open Items for Decision

- SV still evaluating whether DD's model fits his members' expectations
- Staff role specifics and pay not discussed in detail
- SV's 9 cappers — whether they can be absorbed or need individual discussions
- Timeline for decision: SV said "next couple days"
