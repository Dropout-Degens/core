# SV (Discord Community) — Integration Plan — December 13, 2025

---

## DD Systems Shown to SV

- **EV system:** 200K+ OddsJam notifications collected over 2 years, Sports Data IO for verification, filters targeting 80–90% hit rate channels (6–10 bets/channel/day target)
- **Partner promo bot:** State-based partner recommendations, highest-earning partners shown first, claim-and-verify flow
- **Welcome ticket system:** Every new join gets a ticket — one-on-one staff conversation to drive first conversion and acclimation
- **Karma system:** Points earned per message, reaction, daily poll bet — inspired by Real Sports
- **Unit size calculator bot:** Captures bankroll info from new members
- **Bet tracking (Outlier integration):** Members can track bets, report wins/losses in-thread

## SV's Technical Assets

- **Hockey AI model:** Claude 5.2 thinking model + 10,000 simulations, pulls from Daily Face Off, MoneyPuck, ESPN, other sites
  - Predicts: shots on goal, goals, assists, time on ice per player
  - Accuracy: typically 50–70% on player props, usually off by 0.5 when wrong
  - Cross-references with PickFinder data and home/away splits
  - Interesting for integration with DD's OddsJam data in the future
- SV also has development skills — familiar with multiple programming languages, small dev team available for project work (though busy)

## Staff Integration

- SV's staff would come over with paid roles:
  - Admins (4) — role mapping TBD
  - Mods (2-3) — mapped to DD mod roles
  - Developer (Rabbit) — could potentially support DD's dev needs
  - Cappers (9) — case-by-case discussion required
- DD's commission-based staff pay structure would apply

## Member Migration

- SV's 600 members to be invited into DD
- 300 premium members treated as early adopters — protected pricing
- 3-4 lifetime paying members get DD lifetime access
- Acquisition method: DD invite link distributed through SV's existing channels

## Potential Synergies

- SV's hockey model + DD's OddsJam EV data = opportunity for enhanced hockey picks
- SV's collab network (6K-member server collab upcoming) = potential marketing pipeline
- SV's existing Twitter presence for collabs = acquisition channel alignment
