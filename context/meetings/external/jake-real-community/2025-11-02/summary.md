## Overview

Solo planning session the day before the Saturday launch.

Focus is on ensuring staff can effectively onboard Jake's members and transfer knowledge about how DD works.

## Key Context

- Launch is Saturday November 2 — this session is final prep
- Jake's team includes incoming analysts and moderators
- Analysts need full procedure walkthrough (picks, bet tracking, attribution)
- Mods need role clarity: goal is helping Jake's members acclimate to DD
- All staff need backend setup: Discord roles, flags, staff button access
- Resources and goals need to be communicated clearly before Saturday

## Outcomes

- Staff setup plan defined: roles, flags, staff button for each incoming member
- Analyst onboarding scope identified: full picks procedure + attribution process
- Mod role framing established: acclimation support, not picks work
- Goals and metrics to be spelled out for the full staff group
