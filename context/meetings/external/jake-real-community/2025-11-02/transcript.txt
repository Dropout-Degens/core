Basically, I have to get together everything when it comes to getting shrimps community members and staff ready So I need to just understand who on their staff I'm like talking to um and then for each of those guys get them all set up they're not gonna get emails, but they're gonna get like They have to get set up in the back end with our flags and rolls in the and also grab the staff button so I want to get all that done.

And then what else do I have to get done for them? For these guys, I need to just tell them like what they're doing for the mods. Um, and stuff. And like, analysts. For the analysts, I need to onboard them to just the whole procedure. And also, I need to spell out that procedure.

Um, and then for the moderators, basically just tell them. And also for this overall group chat, or in the individual chats themselves, I need to tell the people, like, hey, this is your role, like, this is the goal, like, um... like basically all the resources, but hey, this is your role of we're trying to just help make this switch to the community a lot easier for a lot of the people. And then just the aspect of, Like, actually getting their resources together and telling them the goal of, hey, the goal here is to like, Um, Help all of these community members get acclimated and understand know how to work the community.

And then also just the staff to make sure they understand and have an access to all the resources so that they can actually just give them that knowledge and focus on the pass through of that knowledge. That allows for that. So yeah, I guess that's what I need to do for that. And then I wanna talk to you about, I guess just like, Helping to find if there's anything else that I can get together just like I want to be fully Set when it comes to releasing this for tomorrow so that means everything when it comes to the staff have all their information to also like I've been able to spell out everything that, like the goals and the metrics that we'll be tracking and also just the staff aspect
