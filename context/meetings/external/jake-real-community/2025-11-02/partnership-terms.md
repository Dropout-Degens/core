# Jake (Porsche's Picks) — Partnership Terms — November 2, 2025

---

## Staff Structure

- Jake's incoming team splits into two roles: **analysts** and **moderators**
- Each staff member gets their own Discord setup — no email onboarding
- All staff receive appropriate backend flags, Discord roles, and staff button access

## Analyst Role

- Full procedure walkthrough required before going live
- Scope: picks process, bet tracking, and attribution submission
- Analysts are responsible for the picks side of Porsche's Picks channel

## Moderator Role

- Goal: help Jake's Real Sports members acclimate to DD community
- Not picks-focused — purely community support and transition assistance
- Each mod receives their role framing, goal statement, and relevant resources

## Staff Communication Plan

- Individual or group chat messages to each staff member explaining:
  - Their specific role
  - The goal (community member acclimation and knowledge pass-through)
  - All relevant resources they need access to
- Knowledge transfer is the primary focus — staff must be able to answer member questions

## Metrics and Goals

- Goals and success metrics to be spelled out for all staff before Saturday
- Tracking: member acclimation, resource utilization, community engagement
- Specific attribution and conversion tracking remains as established in prior terms
