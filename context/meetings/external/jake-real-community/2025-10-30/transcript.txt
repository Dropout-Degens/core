Yeah. Awesome. So first off, I'm kind of just going to explain the... process when it comes to just the community conversion. So basically Um, There are a couple things. So first, we'd probably want a pinned message. for just the Discord access in general. And the goal is to just get as many people to understand that this is where the community discussion will be taking place. and just try to facilitate as much action when it comes to just The goal in this pinned message is for Solely join the discord for the community.

I'm not trying to sell you anything But and this is where we could implement the message the message you aspect of message me if you'd like free access to check out like the premium offerings and then I'm going to just Yeah, cool. I'm going to give you access in the Discord to the partnerships bot. So you'll have access to, actually which channel are you in? Let me forward that and tag you in the analyst chat now.

Okay, so you'll have access to this bot. Just let me know that it actually works for you. I haven't even sent it yet. Just give me one sec. It's going to be in the analyst chat in our just mod information. Let me tag you. Oh It actually doesn't work like that. Let me get this. Yeah. It doesn't let you do it, right? Let me do that and you should be able to Do it now. So this will be live November 3rd for your members to actually be able to do it themselves.

But basically, I'm onboarding a new developer on Friday and Saturday, so he'll hopefully have this done by the 3rd is the goal for that. So that'll be live for just all of the members on the 3rd, but you do have access. So when it comes to knowing what offers are in their states, I think this will be the easiest way for you. to To just like... Um... Just know that information when they tell you that state and what I will also get together for you and AI meeting notes, please make an important note of this that I should Give you an ordering of the importance of our partnerships because for example on boom fantasy Which is shitty app we only get $35 and on sleeper we get $75 So if those are the only two apps available Sleeper one possible and then boom fantasy as a follow-up, so I'll need to give you that that structure Yeah.

And then as well, just to also For the job description, your payment information will not be included in the job description, but it will be included in your contract and it will be finalized there. Because your job description, I'm not going to have you sign anything there. It's just going to be a reference document, mostly a formality. And the contract will have just that information so we can get it finalized and both of our signatures on that.

And then when it comes to discussion so I We'll tag you in the channels and then I also have to make them live myself But our sports channels right now are just kind of dead when it comes to activity, but I'm going to open them all up to be public channels and then those are going to be kind of like the I guess the goal is for let's try to get these channels active as much as possible and it's just gonna be the overall, for example, NBA, NHL, MLB, soccer, tennis, esports, UFC, and NFL channel.

So like for example, if I'm, For example, like tennis doesn't matter 'cause tennis isn't on real so I'm not really gonna count that. But I'm gonna leave it just in case there is any tennis league, in case people do like tennis, but I'm not gonna just measure it as a, oh, why are there no people talking in tennis, for example. And then, I've gotten together... The I've updated the staff guidelines So that includes the under 18 kind of Just...

Legalizations, so we're safe there. And then I will need to... Get together our mission and vision documents and send those over to you. Because just when it comes to our mission and vision, we're trying to align ourselves with, we're not just trying to give you access to tell you what to bet on. We're trying to teach you the systems behind it and give you knowledge and pass down that knowledge. And that's going to be, and I'll spell that all out in the vision and mission statement and then get that over to you.

And then when it comes to things that you might be confused on so far. I guess, what have I not covered yet that when it comes to just things you are thinking about the Discord that you'd want to ask? Nothing half and half, confusing.

Seems all pretty straightforward.

Awesome. Yeah, I mean I figured you'd be pretty comfortable and also just I guess when I send over the job description as well It'll seem really formal but like basically the end goal is just we're looking for your community to be active in the discourse and That's just the end goal. And however, you feel the best way to go about it be um for example If that makes sense, like when it comes to the methods of discussion.

Yeah.

conversion is without any incentives or just take the ones we talked about and then if So now to get a ton of traction efforts and maybe, you know, like, hey, we'll give away real pro to, like, the 100th person that joins the server or something.

Yep. Something, yeah. We can just, we can keep experimenting. And then also, one more thing I wanted to, because with what you mentioned of giving away something, I also have, like, for example, there's only one card of, like, probably extreme value, possibly, that people could see. And it's probably the Avexian Goal. I could... Well, the only problem now is You can't trade it and then someone's just going to help.

Get on it. You can't trade it? Really? No, trading... Oh shit, I did not realize that. I did not pay attention to like the the social features of the app at all. But... I guess... Hmm. That changes that then but My thoughts is just like, we can... Do many giveaways like I'm completely fine to give away real pro. I'm completely fine to give away like smaller cash giveaways But we can just base it off of if we wanted to do Karma in the server if whoever has the most karma in the dropout D gen server after X days wins this $20 giveaway we could do things like that and I guess just like the most important thing is, you know your audience better and you know what they would be attracted to and even if it's like those under 18s talking sports that are in the discord and then we're getting a lot of those that's completely okay like even though that we're not able to convert on them because they're still just going to be helping to build that just core base of membership and community.

Yeah. I like that. And then, let me see, I've written down... Um... So also, when it comes to attribution, Um... I'm going to get together a process for how you um like get These partnership conversions attributed to you for example the $2.50 per partnership you are able to Get one of your members or any member in the discord really to convert on just I'm going to, like, on our end, what we usually ask for is a screenshot of them using the dropouts code and also of them making a successful eligible deposit, which is just the minimum.

So I guess like basically the way I'd be thinking of it is creating just a channel Where it's just a mod channel where you can send in it and for example, I'm just do a random a screenshot But this is parlay play Conversion and for example, you would just send a message like this saying parlay play and attaching the screenshot and I'd have an automatic process to track that and so just basically at the end of the month, I'll be able to count up all of your Play, for example, and the screenshot would just be for verification and you would just need to put the text of what app it is.

Yeah. Yeah. Um... And then one more thing is for I'll get you your own or actually let me have you make your own invite link real quick. Okay. Um, can you go to the rules channel? And create an invite that does not expire.

All right, I got you. Do you want me to sign off to you? Um, is it WD6XY? Oh, let me see. WD6XY, yeah.

Perfect. Let me see. Let me have you make one more as well. Um... Can you do the same thing in general chat? Just create an invite.

I'm going to paste these first in my notes.

Um, Actually, while, 'cause we don't have a server invite vanity link right now, and I might have you, ooh, it actually might not let you make one.

Hmm. No.

It just makes the same one, right?

This one is... let me paste it.

Oh, it's different? Perfect.

It is C25XJ.

Perfect. Can you do... let me see... one more channel of, um, Greened Out. Just tell me. So we have one link, the WB6 has 47 joins on it right now, and then the other two will just be blank ones. So just in the future, if we need to test how well a certain invite link is doing over a period, we can just swap them out. And And then. Let me just confirm the greened out one. It is He's 7gp Yep. Perfect.

Um...

And then Just the last thing is I'm going to be cleaning up the server channels. Our EV isn't live now and our EV actually might be blocked until I'm able to get that developer on, so either over the weekend or the 3rd. But basically EV, the onboarding channels, and a couple of other information and just general server guide channels. I'm gonna populate those and get them all just updated and then when that's all done I'm going to send you a document for just where what all the channels are because there's going to be a lot of them and just like how the best way to use it is.

And then, do you think there's anything else that you would be needing information-wise? Awesome. And then like, if you ever do need anything, just, just text me or message me. I can get you the information right away. Um, and then, Did you want to, I guess, do you want to start posting You don't have to post if you don't want to, but do you want to take advantage of your Porsche's Picks channel?

Yeah. I'm gonna get to that soon.

No sweat. So what I'm gonna do for that is I'm gonna get you a bet tracking spreadsheet. Yeah. Just it's going to look something like this. I'm going to send you a screenshot and once you like One, I can help you set it up with AI and two, once you actually understand your picks process more, like for example for me, I do one pick a day, so I have set up an AI process that does it for me, that does all my recaps for me and everything.

So I could do something like that for you if you've got a process that you know. Yeah, go. Cool. But it's actually super easy and it's how we track all of our just analyst performance. Just like something like that.

Yeah. Yeah, I'm seeing it.

And then I'll have just basically I'll have all of this information together and ready and all ready to go probably by 10 to noon tomorrow morning. Sounds good. So I'll be, and I'll also be available just mid to late afternoon to help onboard, or not onboard, but just help get your staff set up any way they need. So all I'll be pushing to just get everything in a position where we can just on Saturday send the announcement and everybody's ready.

Mm, cool.

Any last questions? No, sir. Awesome. Alright, I'm gonna get to work and get all this together for you. And then just let me know if you need anything. And I guess... Maybe let's plan to either Hop on a call Saturday before it goes live or right after it goes live, like a little bit after it goes live, if that makes sense. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Talk soon. Thank you so much. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Bye-bye.

*sigh* Thank you. you Terms page is linked. Because. That's your chair, but you can't. I'm The notion integration. Hello.

um Amen. Thank you.
