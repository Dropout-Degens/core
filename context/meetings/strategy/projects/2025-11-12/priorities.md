# Strategy Session — Project Backlog — Priorities — November 12, 2025

---

## Scoped Projects (Ready for Development)

| Project | Complexity | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Partner Promo Bot Update | Low — vanity updates only, core already built | High — directly improves conversions |
| Weekly Rewards Update | Low — prize distribution + karma refresh | Medium — engagement loop |
| Greened Out Channel | Medium — auto-react is easy, image parsing is its own project | High — social media content, community proof |
| Responsible Gaming Channel | Low — content creation, read-only channel | Medium — positioning reinforcement |
| Invite Link Rotation | Medium — automation needed | Medium — combats bot spam |
| Finances in Database | Medium — Stripe + WAP connections, expense categorization | High — admin dashboard prerequisite |

## Deferred Projects (Need More Scoping)

| Project | Reason Deferred |
|---|---|
| Website Improvement | Needs more thought on redesign approach and admin dashboard scope |
| Email Marketing | Not scoped yet |
| Social Media | Not scoped yet |
| Tracking Partnership Conversions | Not scoped yet — needs better statistics pipeline |
| Ticketing System | Referenced but scoped separately |

## Dependencies

- **Finances in Database** → unblocks **Admin Dashboard** → unblocks **Website Improvement**
- **Partner Promo Bot Update** → unblocks better conversion flow → unblocks premium price increase
- **Greened Out historical data** → unblocks **Social Media** content (e.g., "community has shared $1.5M in wins")
- **Greened Out image parsing** (deriving dollar values from screenshots) is potentially its own project
