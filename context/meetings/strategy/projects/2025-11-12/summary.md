# Strategy Session — Project Backlog Scoping — November 12, 2025

**Format:** Solo planning session (Dax) with AI assistant guiding PRD structure
**Focus:** Scoping out the full project backlog with PRD-style documentation for each project

## Overview

Dax worked through scoping every major project that needs to be done for Dropout Degens, guided by an AI assistant asking structured questions. Each project was documented with: opportunity (why it matters), what's being built, how it works, KPI impact, long-term potential, and next steps.
