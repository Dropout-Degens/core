# Strategy Session — EV Filter Publishing — November 8, 2025

**Format:** Solo planning session (Dax)
**Focus:** Single project deep dive — publishing EV filters to public channels

---

## Overview

Dax scoped out the project of publishing EV filters from the backlog into sport-specific public channels. This session focused on one project in PRD-style depth: the opportunity, what's being built, how it works, KPI measurement, long-term potential, and next steps.

## Key Insight

DD has been sitting on a large volume of EV data from OddsJam and Daily Grind Fantasy but hasn't been doing anything with it publicly. The data shows that when DGF says an event has a 56.1% odds-to-hit, it actually hits ~65% of the time — and DD can verify this against retrospective data to see they're right ~80% of the time. This is a provable edge that DD hasn't surfaced to users yet.

## What Was Planned

A filter system that takes the raw EV notification firehose and routes profitable alerts into sport-specific Discord channels (NFL → football channel, MLB → baseball, NBA/NCAAB → basketball, etc.). Filters would be based on retrospective data analysis of which markets are actually profitable.

## Long-Term Vision

- Proving the EV data works opens the door to affiliate links with major sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings) embedded in EV alerts
- Creates a marketing narrative around validated, data-driven betting
- Unblocks a major marketing push
- Eventually move from static filters to a dynamic algorithm
