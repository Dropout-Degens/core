## Next Steps

1. [ ] **Launch Flif EV channel** — Get Flif-specific EV alerts routing to the correct channel
2. [ ] **Analyze retrospective data** — Go through all historical EV data to identify profitable markets per sport
3. [ ] **Define filters** — Create specific filter criteria for each sport (thresholds, market types, odds-to-hit ranges)
4. [ ] **Pass filters to dev team** — Hand completed filter definitions to Bellcube for implementation in the bot
5. [ ] **Consider algorithm** — Plan for future transition from static filters to dynamic algorithm (not immediate priority)
