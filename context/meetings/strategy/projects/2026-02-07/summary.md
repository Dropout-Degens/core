# Strategy Session — ASAP To-Dos for $50/Month — February 7, 2026

**Format:** Solo planning session (Dax)
**Focus:** Prioritizing everything that needs to happen to raise subscription pricing to $50/month

---

## Overview

Dax walked through every ASAP to-do blocking the price increase to $50/month. This was a stream-of-consciousness prioritization session covering EV publishing, ticketing system, staff cleanup, content updates, analyst onboarding, Discord server cleanup, and re-engagement campaigns. The session ended with Dax executing some of the quick actionables in real time.

## Core Thesis

The price increase to $50/month is blocked by a chain of prerequisites: EV needs to be published and proven, the ticketing system needs to work (especially premium walkthrough), content and value channels need updating, staff need to be onboarded on conversions, and the Discord needs to be cleaned up for new members arriving from paid promotions ($200 Hive Index spend bringing ~200 expected visitors).

## Key Context

- NHL season comes back late March — Dax has a 1-2 week window to publish NHL EV before then
- Flif EV is already published but sending to wrong channels
- $200 already spent on Hive Index promotion — ~200 new people will be testing onboarding
- Dax has been individually messaging every past subscriber to re-engage them
- Staff have been onboarded on conversions (everyone except Luke at time of recording)
- Planning weekly analyst meetings (proposing Monday, Wednesday, or Friday options)

## Actions Taken During Session

- Messaged all staff with old staff entity role to log into website (for role removal)
- Updated backend EV roles
- Ingested new EV data
- Cleaned up old notify and bot roles
- Started purging and tracking invite links
