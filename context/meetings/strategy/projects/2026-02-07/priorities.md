# Strategy Session — ASAP To-Dos — Priorities — February 7, 2026

## #1 Priority: Raise Pricing to $50/Month

Everything below is sequenced as prerequisites for the price increase.

### Blockers (Must Complete First)

1. **Publish EV** — The #1 blocker. Justifies the $50 price point.
   - Update EV info channel with validated methodology and historical results
   - Publish NHL EV before season comes back (late March — 1-2 week window)
   - Fix Flif EV channel routing (sending to wrong channels)
   - If AWS doesn't work, fall back to Google Sheets (same data)
   - Need a call with Bellcube to fix channel routing

2. **Premium Walkthrough Tickets** — ASAP. New subscribers need a guided onboarding experience.
   - Must work before price increase — $50/month customers expect a polished experience
   - Expired sub tickets also need work: ask "where did we fail?" and offer partner signup for extended free access

3. **Content & Value Updates** — Every channel needs updated strategy content.
   - Betting tips channel needs more strategy depth
   - Server onboarding (lobby, rules channel) needs updating
   - All content should reflect education-first positioning

### Important (Should Complete Before/During Price Increase)

4. **Staff Cleanup**
   - Old staff: log into website, remove roles from database
   - Staff profile visibility: get profile command should show demographic info (state, age range, bankroll bot data, membership history, where they came from)
   - Audit log: update staff tags per channel (different teams tagged for different ticket types)

5. **Staff Onboarding**
   - All analysts need to be onboarded on conversion system and percentages
   - Luke still needs 1-on-1 (was moving last week)
   - Weekly analyst meetings starting (propose 3 time slots: Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
   - If analysts can't make the weekly, they must schedule a 1-on-1
   - Need weekly with JP (mod) starting next week
   - Staff need to be more proactive

6. **Re-Engagement Campaign**
   - Message literally every person in the database individually
   - Apologize for slow period, explain what's been built
   - Share development timeline for upcoming features
   - Ask them to tag Dax in the server instead of DMs (easier to stay active)

7. **Discord Cleanup**
   - Remove all old staff roles from members
   - Reset all notify and bot roles
   - Purge and redo all invite links
   - Delete old threads
   - Can't delete old channels until call with Zach

### Lobby/Onboarding Flow

- When members join: display where they're from (source tracking)
- Understanding where members come from → understanding conversion likelihood
- Mom test approach for premium walkthrough: "What are your pains?"
