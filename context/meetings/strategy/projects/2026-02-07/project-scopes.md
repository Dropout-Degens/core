# Strategy Session — ASAP To-Dos — Project Scopes — February 7, 2026

---

## EV Publishing

### What Needs to Happen
- **EV info channel:** Purge all old content, rewrite with accurate methodology and validated historical results
- **Goal:** People look at it and think "this is really cool, they have a lot of data, this is impressive"
- **NHL focus:** Publish before season comes back (late March). Dax has downtime before NHL to do this.
- **Flif EV:** Already published but routing to wrong channels — needs Bellcube call to fix
- **Fallback:** If AWS doesn't work for hosting, use Google Sheets (same data, just different display)
- **Data source:** Copy of the DFS sheet, focus only on hockey for now

### Premium Walkthrough Experience
- Mom test approach: identify user pain points
- Expired sub ticket: "Where did we fail in delivering value? What can we do better?"
- Re-engagement offer: sign up for partner → get 14 free days (normally 7) through the re-engagement ticket
- Question bot potential: automated pain point discovery

## Staff Visibility Improvements

### Get Profile Command Updates
Staff should see more demographic info when pulling up a user:
- State (from partner promo bot)
- Age range (18+ or 21+)
- Bankroll bot info
- Where they joined from (source tracking)
- Membership history (how many times, paid or free)

### Audit Log Tag Updates
- Different ticket channels should tag different staff teams
- Free access tickets → tag staff + mod (or staff + head staff)
- Will be configured per channel as Dax works through them

### Questions for Zach
- Do staff have access to "get profile admin" or just "get profile"?
- Which one should staff be using?

## Staff & Analyst Onboarding

### Status
- All analysts talked to except Luke (was moving)
- Luke: texted to schedule this weekend or during the week
- Need to start weekly analyst meetings (propose Monday/Wednesday/Friday)
- Need weekly 1-on-1 with JP (mod) starting next week

### Weekly Analyst Meeting Format
- Check: who's doing the best this week?
- Are we actually converting?
- Tracking spreadsheets up to date?
- If can't make the weekly → must schedule a 1-on-1
- Goal: get analysts more engaged and proactive

---

## Re-Engagement Campaign

### Approach
- Message literally every person in the database individually via Discord DM
- Messaging: "Sorry it took me so long, I spent the past week getting staff onboarded and looking through data"
- Share what's coming: EV release timeline, development cycle updates
- Ask them to tag Dax in the server instead of DMs (easier to stay active publicly)
- Offer free access as incentive to return

## Document Management

### Three Document Types
1. **Context** — AI/operational context (stored in GitHub core repo)
2. **Staff** — Staff-facing documents (stored in Routine)
3. **Official** — Word docs (stored separately)

All stored in different places — acknowledged as funny but acceptable for now.
