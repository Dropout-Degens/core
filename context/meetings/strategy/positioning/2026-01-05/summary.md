# Positioning Session — Discord Channel Architecture — January 5, 2026

**Format:** Solo session (Dax)
**Focus:** Walking through the full Discord server channel structure, support ticket categories, and the 5% staff bonus points system

---

## Overview

Dax walked through the Discord server's channel architecture category by category, explaining the purpose and flow of each channel — particularly the support category which contains the bulk of the automated ticketing system. The session also introduced the staff bonus points system (5% pool, 1/3/5 points per partner tier) and touched on the educational framing for each partner's pitch. This session is heavily operational — translating the education-first positioning into concrete Discord channel design.

## Key Context

- Premium walkthrough ticket system targeted for late January to mid-February backend implementation
- Server welcome tickets will be source-specific (triggered by high-converting invite links)
- Members can accumulate up to 10 free days of all-access through welcome message (7-day trial) + server welcome ticket (3-day offer)
- Staff bonus pool is 5% of partnership revenue, distributed by points
- Partner pitch documentation needed: educational differentiation points for each partner (not just promos)
- Responsible gaming channel being created with resources, tips, and ticket option

## Core Thesis

Every channel in the Discord should serve the education-first positioning. Support channels are designed for personalized, hands-on engagement (not self-service). The ticketing system is the primary conversion mechanism — welcome tickets, premium walkthroughs, and expired sub tickets all create 1-on-1 touchpoints for staff to educate and convert.
