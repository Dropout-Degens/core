# Positioning Session — Vision & Positioning — January 5, 2026

---

## Partner Educational Framing

### The Approach
- Each partner needs a documented pitch that explains **why** members should use them — not just that they have a promo
- These are educational differentiation points, not sales pitches

### Examples Discussed
- **Fliff:** Free daily dollar every day — strategy is to not keep real money in, just use the free plays
- **Onyx:** 100 free picks + same-game parlay profit boosts (only social sportsbook with profit boosts) + closest experience to DraftKings
- **Thrills:** 10% market boost — if you're already placing a wager, place it here for the automatic boost
- **General approach:** "This is what differentiates this partner from the others" — not "sign up because promo"

### Documentation Need
- Dax noted this as a personal to-do: compile the educational pitch points for all partners
- These will be used by staff when converting and in the resources/partners channel

## Responsible Gaming Positioning

### Channel Purpose
- Reiterate that sports betting is gambling with inherent risks
- Provide a guide on responsible betting practices
- Bankroll management, unit systems, data-backed decisions

### Key Messaging
- "Sports isn't always about betting" — Layup savings app as alternative
- "Don't approach bets as gambles — approach them as smart decisions backed by data and research"
- The "smarter better" approach aligns directly with DD's education-first positioning
- Ticket option available if members need a place to talk about gambling concerns

### Tone
- Not preachy or negative — educational and supportive
- Responsible gaming is part of the education mission, not separate from it
