# Positioning Session — Roadmap — January 5, 2026

---

## Current State

- Discord channel architecture is designed and categorized
- Most support channels exist but automation is not yet built
- Premium walkthrough and expired sub ticket automation targeted for late January to mid-February
- Server welcome ticket automation needs development (source-specific triggers)
- Staff bonus points system designed but not yet implemented
- Partner educational pitch documentation not yet compiled
- Responsible gaming channel needs more content

## What's Needed Next

### Backend Development (Blocked on Dev Capacity)
- Premium walkthrough ticket automation (auto-create on new subscription/trial)
- Expired sub ticket automation (auto-create on subscription/trial end)
- Server welcome ticket automation (source-specific invite link triggers)
- Staff bonus points tracking system

### Content Creation (Dax)
- Partner educational pitch points for all ~20+ partners
- Responsible gaming channel content (tips, resources, Layup positioning)
- Server guide update (channel directory)
- Betting tips channel content (strategies, terms, resources)
- Weekly rewards prize distribution update

### Staff Alignment
- Staff need to understand the ticketing system and their role in each ticket type
- Staff need the partner pitch documentation to effectively convert in tickets
- Staff bonus system needs to be communicated once implemented

## Dependencies

```
Partner pitch docs created → Staff can educate during ticket interactions → Better conversion rates
Ticket automation built → Staff respond to automated tickets → Personalized experience at scale
Staff bonus implemented → Staff incentivized to convert → Revenue increases → Bonus pool grows
```
