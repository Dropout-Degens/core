# Positioning Session — Vision & Positioning — October 2, 2025

---

## Market Differentiation

### The Problem with the Industry
- Most sports betting Discords and services are subscription-based pick-selling operations
- Their goal is to keep members paying for picks, not to teach them how to find their own
- The market is oversaturated with this same model

### DD's Differentiation
- **Education-first positioning:** Teach members how to find profitable bets, not just what to bet
- **Partnership-funded model:** ~20 partnerships allow DD to focus on education rather than subscription revenue
- **Tool literacy:** Teach members how to use tools (line shopping, EV, bankroll management) rather than just providing outputs
- **Example approach:** "You should use this app because they have line discrepancies on X — I wouldn't use them consistently, but keep an eye on them for this reason" vs. "Sign up because they have a good promo"

### Target Demographic
- Largely 18-21 year olds from organic Fliff Discord marketing
- Undereducated bettors entering the space for the first time
- Perfect customer for education-first positioning — they need guidance, not just picks

### Branding Opportunity
- Potential to lean into the "Dropout Degens" name: "Drop your degenerate gambling habits"
- Tone: Stop doing parlays, stick to straight bets, use data-backed decisions
- Not finalized but identified as a branding angle worth exploring

## Culture & Values

### Transparency
- Be as transparent as possible about outcomes — not everything wins
- Take accountability for results, use losses as learning opportunities
- Staff interactions should model this transparency with the community
- Without transparency and accountability, you can't build the systems needed to become profitable

### Education Over Conversion
- Staff goal should NOT be converting members to premium subscriptions
- Staff goal SHOULD be converting members onto partnerships so they get free premium access + tool utility
- Approach partnerships educationally: explain WHY each tool/app is useful, not just that it exists

### Community Tone
- Friendly, helpful, positive
- No putting down members or negative tonality
- Discussions should add context and factors that members might not have considered
- Goal: members making more educated decisions through community engagement

## How DD Should Be Described

- **"More than a community — a community resource"**
- The one-stop shop for sports betting education
- Members should say: "They taught me everything — how to find bets, where to place them, and strategies for how many to place"
- Members should have all the skills they need to be successful and profitable
- Content should be as easy to understand and accessible as possible

## Layup Positioning

- Kept completely separate from DD branding
- Used as a utility offering: "Just because you like sports doesn't mean you always have to be betting"
- Layup is a sports savings app — uses sports games as triggers for saving money instead of betting
- Positioned as the responsible/smart alternative within the sports space
