# Positioning Session — Roadmap — October 2, 2025

---

## Current Stage

- Pivot to education-first positioning began ~1.5 years ago (early 2024)
- ~20 partnerships acquired
- Community largely organic from Fliff Discord marketing (18-21 demographic)
- Core positioning thesis is articulated but not yet fully implemented across content and operations

## What's Next

### Immediate
- Create core company documents: mission statement, vision, goals
- Use this session's context as the foundation for those documents

### Short-Term
- Implement education-first approach across all content and staff interactions
- Shift partnership conversion approach from promo-pushing to educational framing
- Staff alignment on the education-first culture and conversion approach

### Long-Term
- Scale community size to improve partnership negotiating power
- Make DD the recognized one-stop shop for sports betting education
- All resources easily understandable and accessible
- Members should be self-sufficient: able to find bets, find best odds, manage bankroll

## Dependencies

```
Education-first content created → Staff adopt the approach → Members experience the difference
Partnership conversion approach updated → Members convert through education → Revenue sustains model
Community grows → Better partnership terms → More value for members → More growth
```

## Note

This session was primarily foundational — establishing the "why" and "what" of the pivot. Specific project scoping and operational implementation were not covered in detail here.
