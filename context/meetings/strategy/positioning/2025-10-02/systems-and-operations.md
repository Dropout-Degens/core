## Partnership Model

### Current State
- ~20 partnerships across betting apps, tools, and resources
- Partnerships were accumulated over the past year and a half
- Community size and younger demographic were leveraged to acquire partnerships

### How Partnerships Enable the Model
- Revenue from partnership conversions replaces dependency on subscription revenue
- Members can get free premium access by signing up through DD's partner links
- DD can negotiate better sign-on bonuses and resources as community grows
- Education-first approach naturally drives conversions: teaching members WHY to use a tool leads to organic signups

### Partnership Conversion Approach
- Staff should explain the educational value of each partner, not just push promos
- Example: "Use Thrills because they have a 10% market boost — if you're already placing this wager, place it on Thrills for the boost"
- Example: "Use line shopping across multiple sportsbooks — find where minus-120 beats minus-123"
- Goal: Members understand the strategic advantage, then convert because they genuinely want the tool

## Staff Operations

### Staff Role in Education Model
- Help members get set up on apps and tools
- Teach members how to use each resource and the strategy behind it
- Engage in community discussions that add analytical context and additional factors
- Focus on converting to partnerships (free access path), not pushing premium subscriptions

### Community Engagement
- Discussions and conversations are the core value — they surface factors members wouldn't consider alone
- No single right answer in sports betting — community dialogue improves decision quality
- Staff should model the educated, analytical approach in their own community interactions

## Long-Term Vision

### Community Growth Strategy
- Scale community to leverage size for better partnership terms (sign-on bonuses, exclusive resources)
- Don't gatekeep knowledge — make everything accessible
- Create the most positive reference frame around betting possible
- Goal: DD becomes known as where smart bettors learn and engage
