# Positioning Session — Roadmap — December 13, 2025

---

## Current State

- Education-first pivot articulated but not yet fully implemented
- ~20 partnerships accumulated, conversion systems not yet built
- Community engagement is minimal (acknowledged as acceptable while building systems)
- Development is the primary blocker (Bellcube availability, student developer helping)
- Churned members need re-engagement once systems are in place

## Sequenced Roadmap

### Phase 1: Finish the Pivot
- Complete education-first content across all channels
- Update all messaging, onboarding, and staff approach
- Build out partner conversion systems (Partner Promo Bot, welcome tickets)

### Phase 2: Build Conversion Infrastructure
- Welcome ticket automation (per marketing source)
- Premium walkthrough tickets (per new subscriber/trial)
- Exit tickets (per churned subscriber)
- State/age demographic tracking for tailored partner triggers
- Partner Promo Bot: jurisdiction-filtered partner display with DD codes

### Phase 3: Re-Engagement
- Email and DM churned members once systems are in place
- Share what's been built, offer return incentives
- Target: members who left during the low-engagement building period

### Phase 4: Paid Acquisition
- Social media campaign (TikTok, Instagram, Meta ads)
- Requires: conversion systems working + community engagement base established
- Unit economics support scaling: $2/customer, 8% conversion rate to break even
- Focus on channels with best LTV-to-conversion metrics

### Phase 5: Iteration
- Email marketing integration
- Understand which acquisition channels produce highest multi-partner converters
- Iterate user journey based on data and feedback
- Scale spending on best-performing channels

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Development bandwidth | All conversion features, ticket automation, bots | Partially solved (student dev + Bellcube when available) |
| Community engagement capacity | New members arrive to low activity | Need hire or community merger |
| Dax's bandwidth | Day-to-day engagement limited | Need staff/partner to cover |
| JP and Dante capacity | Not meeting intended role scope | Need role redefinition or replacement |

## Key Metrics to Track

- Partner conversion rate (per marketing source)
- Multi-partner conversion rate (members converting on 2+ partners)
- Customer acquisition cost by channel
- Customer LTV by acquisition source
- Churn rate and exit ticket feedback
- Time-to-first-conversion after joining
