# Positioning Session — Systems & Operations — December 13, 2025

## User Journey Flow

### Acquisition → Server → Conversion
1. **Marketing channels** (TikTok, Instagram, Meta ads, Discord marketing) → all lead to one action: **joining the server**
2. **On join:** DD knows the invite link source (which marketing channel they came from)
3. **Welcome message:** Automated DM with 7-day free trial link (puts them on billing)
4. **Welcome ticket:** Individualized ticket created based on source — staff personally messages and converts
5. **Partner Promo Bot interaction:** Member selects state (18+ or 21+) → sees available partners with DD's code in their jurisdiction
6. **Conversion:** Member signs up for partner(s) → earns free premium access days
7. **Premium walkthrough ticket:** Personalized onboarding for new subscribers/trial users
8. **Exit ticket (if they churn):** "Where did we fail? What can we do better?" → re-engagement opportunity

### What DD Knows About Members (Data Points)
- When they joined
- Which invite link / marketing source
- State (from Partner Promo Bot interaction)
- Age range (18+ or 21+)
- Which partners they've claimed
- Which partners they can't claim (already used, wrong jurisdiction)

### Conversion Systems Needed
- Partner Promo Bot: show jurisdiction-filtered partners with DD codes
- Welcome tickets: auto-created per marketing source for high-converting channels
- Premium walkthrough tickets: auto-created for new subscribers/trial users
- Exit tickets: auto-created when subscription/trial ends
- State demographic tracking: enables tailored partnership triggers

## Customer Acquisition Economics

### Current Channels
- Fliff Discord / organic: ~$0.25-0.30 per customer
- Meta ads (not currently running): ~$1-2 per customer

### Unit Economics
- Minimum revenue per single-partner conversion: ~$50
- Can afford up to $50 CAC per customer
- At $2/customer via Meta: $100 spend → 50 people → need 2 conversions (8%) to break even
- Multi-partner conversions within first 7 days = successful ROI
- Scalable: once conversion systems are proven, pour money into Meta/social acquisition

### 21+ Partnerships
- Unlocking in ~2 months (from December 2025)
- Will increase customer LTV by 40-60%
- Real sportsbook partners (DraftKings-tier) vs. current social/sweepstakes books

## Development & Capacity

### Development Blockers
- Primary blocker: Bellcube (Zack) is job searching, limited availability
- Student developer from college helping part-time
- All conversion features, ticketing automation, and bot systems are blocked by development bandwidth
- Once development capacity is stabilized, should get "a pretty good pace going"

### Capacity Gaps
- Dax's personal bandwidth for daily community engagement has decreased
- JP and Dante "aren't quite cutting it" for their intended roles
- Need: someone for community engagement + marketing (could be solved by a merger/acquisition)
- Two roles needed: (1) getting new members in, (2) engaging with existing members
- Could potentially combine into one role or solve with community merger

### Post-Development Sequence
1. Conversion systems built and working
2. Community engagement base established (so new members don't arrive to nothing)
3. Social media marketing campaign begins
4. Understand LTV-to-conversion metrics
5. Scale acquisition on highest-performing channels
6. Add email marketing and iterate based on feedback
