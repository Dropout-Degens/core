# Positioning Session — Business Model & Growth Strategy — December 13, 2025

**Format:** Solo session (Dax)
**Focus:** Solidifying the education-first pivot with concrete business model numbers, customer acquisition economics, user journey flow, and development roadmap

---

## Overview

Dax built on the foundational positioning from October by adding concrete business model numbers and growth strategy. This session covered customer LTV through partnership conversions (~$1,500), acquisition cost economics, the user journey from marketing to conversion, subscription pricing strategy ($50/month), and development blockers. The session bridges the vision (education-first) with the execution plan (how to actually make money and grow).

## Key Context

- Partnership revenue generates ~$1,500 in customer LTV through conversions — roughly 25x subscription revenue
- Customer acquisition cost: ~$0.25-0.30 via current channels (Fliff/Discord), ~$1-2 via Meta ads
- With $50 minimum revenue per single-partner conversion, DD can afford up to $50 CAC
- At $2/customer via Meta: 50 customers per $100 spend, need 2 conversions (8%) to break even
- 21+ partnerships unlocking in ~2 months would increase customer LTV by 40-60%
- Development is the primary blocker — Bellcube (Zack) is job searching, student developer helping from college
- Dax's personal capacity for day-to-day community engagement has decreased

## Core Thesis

The education-first positioning isn't just a brand play — it's the financial model. Partnership conversion revenue (25x subscription revenue) means DD should optimize for conversions, not subscriptions. Raising subscription pricing to $50/month actually incentivizes partner conversions (free access path), and the unit economics support aggressive paid acquisition once conversion systems are built.
