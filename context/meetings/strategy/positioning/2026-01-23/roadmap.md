# Positioning Session — Roadmap — January 23, 2026

---

## Four-Stage Roadmap

### Stage 1: Update Content & Align Operations
- Update all Discord educational content to match education-first positioning
- Align daily staff operations with the updated vision
- Release Fliff EV filter
- Update community onboarding and responsible gaming section
- Update ticketing system
- Staff re-onboarded on updated vision
- **This is the foundation — nothing else works until this is done**

### Stage 2: Retention Tools & Community Observation
- Build and deploy retention tools
- Observe how community interacts with updated positioning
- Focus on conversion systems (both staff-manual and development-automated)
- Staff begin actively converting using partnership knowledge
- Evaluate: what's working, what's not?

### Stage 3: Conversion Focus & Community Acquisition
- Staff conversion becomes a measured, tracked KPI
- Development builds automated conversion systems (welcome tickets, Partner Promo Bot optimization)
- Acquire additional communities (merger/acquisition)
- Re-engage churned members with updated positioning and systems
- Establish community engagement base for incoming members

### Stage 4: Scale Acquisition & Iterate
- Social media marketing campaign (TikTok, Instagram, Meta)
- Email marketing
- Website SEO and organic acquisition
- Scale spending on best-performing channels
- Iterate based on data and feedback

## Goals by Quarter

### Q1 Goals (January–March 2026)
1. Differentiate Discord positioning (finish the education-first content update)
2. Staff culture adoption (re-onboard, contracts, KPIs, bonus system)
3. Optimized conversion funnel (welcome tickets, messaging, Partner Promo Bot)
4. Raise Discord pricing to $50/month
5. Improved server retention (systems for member engagement)
6. Expand Discord resources (more partnerships, 21+ sportsbooks)
7. Acquire additional communities (medium priority)

### Q2 Goals (April–June 2026)
- Strengthen brand identity (evaluate and iterate on education-first positioning)
- Rebrand website positioning (SEO, blogs, content, potential redesign)
- Automate operations (reduce manual overhead)
- Create referral program (member-side, based on staff program learnings)
- Increase community engagement (events, announcements, activity)
- Improve premium churn (exit tickets, experience, pricing evaluation)

### Year-Long Goals (Q4 / All Year)
1. **Increase partner conversions** — The #1 metric. Conversion revenue is 25x subscription revenue. Are members converting on multiple partners?
2. **Enhanced decisions with data** — Dashboards, staff access to data, smarter decisions driven by metrics. Is the data making DD better?

## Key Insight

> "We can basically capture a whole year's worth of subscription revenue in a single month through conversions. We need to see if we're able to be doing that."

The entire roadmap is oriented around proving and scaling this conversion model. Everything else (content, retention, staff, acquisition) serves the goal of converting members onto partnerships.
