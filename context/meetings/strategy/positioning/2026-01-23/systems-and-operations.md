# Positioning Session — Systems & Operations — January 23, 2026

## Staff Bonus System (Detailed)

### Points Structure
- 5% of partnership revenue goes to staff bonus pool
- Points per conversion based on partner tier:
  - **1 point:** Lower-value partners (Props Cash, etc.)
  - **3 points:** Mid-tier partners
  - **5 points:** Top partners (Onyx, Thrills, Sleeper, ParlayPlay)
- Potential for double-points promotions on specific partners during certain weeks
- Points translate to proportional share of the 5% bonus pool

### Staff Conversion Tracking
- Every conversion attributed to the staff member who facilitated it
- Referral tracking: members brought in by staff are tracked, and their subsequent conversions also earn points
- All partner promo claims will eventually go through the Partner Promo Bot (optimized conversion funnel)

## Optimized Conversion Funnel

### Components
- Welcome tickets (source-specific, automated)
- Welcome messaging (all channels and DMs)
- Staff messaging approach (educational framing)
- Partner Promo Bot (jurisdiction-filtered partner display)
- Premium walkthrough tickets (subscriber onboarding)
- Exit tickets (churn re-engagement)

### Staff Role
- Staff manually convert while systems are being built
- Staff have access to all partnership information needed for conversions
- Staff should be gaining experience and building conversion skills now
- Development will automate and optimize what staff learn to do manually

## Retention Systems

### Improved Server Retention (Goal)
- Every member should engage more and stay longer
- Systems needed for staff to help members stay
- Staff goals should include retention metrics
- Specific mechanisms TBD — will be projected out after Q1

### Improve Premium Churn (Goal — Q2)
- Better exit tickets with actionable feedback
- Overall experience improvements
- Evaluate: do we need to lower pricing again?
- Staff responsibility to manage exit ticket conversations

## Operational Automation (Goal)

- Everything that can be automated should be
- Example: Play of the Day — once the first message is sent, the rest should be automatic
- Reduce manual operational overhead so staff can focus on engagement and conversions

## Community Acquisition (Goal)

### The Problem
- Community is "a little bit dead" — acknowledged directly
- Staff turnover caused loss of their subsequent community members
- Low engagement makes it hard for new members arriving from marketing

### Solutions
- Acquire additional communities (merger/acquisition) — medium priority in Q1
- Re-engage churned members once systems are in place
- Establish community engagement base before scaling paid acquisition
- Can't pour marketing dollars into a server with no activity

## Referral Program (Goal — Q2)

### Member-Side Referral
- Separate from staff bonus — this is for regular members
- Members earn rewards for bringing new members who convert
- Exact mechanics TBD — evaluate staff program first, then adapt for members
- Points system likely, but needs scoping
