# Positioning Session — Goals & Roadmap — January 23, 2026

**Format:** Solo session (Dax)
**Focus:** Defining all business goals across Q1/Q2/Q4, organizing them into a 4-stage roadmap, and identifying documents that need to be created

---

## Overview

Dax walked through the full set of business goals — 14+ individual goals organized across Q1, Q2, and year-long (Q4) timeframes, then collapsed them into a 4-stage roadmap. The session covers everything from finishing the education-first positioning to staff culture adoption, pricing increases, retention improvements, community acquisition, website SEO, referral programs, and data-driven decision-making. Dax also identified 6+ company documents that need to be created.

## Key Context

- 18 "business schools" (goals) identified, organized by quarter and priority
- Community engagement is acknowledged as low — acceptable during building phase but needs addressing
- Staff turnover and their subsequent community members were lost due to capacity/compensation issues
- Conversion revenue is ~25x subscription revenue — partner conversions are the key metric
- Staff need contracts, KPIs, and the bonus system to be properly incentivized
- Alex (referenced) will need to be pitched on the pivot when pricing is raised
- This session is the most comprehensive strategic planning session to date

## Core Thesis

DD has 4 stages to execute: (1) finish updating content and operations to match education-first positioning, (2) build retention tools and observe community interaction with the updated positioning, (3) focus on conversions with both staff effort and development systems, (4) scale acquisition. Everything after the positioning is complete should be measured and iterated on with data.
