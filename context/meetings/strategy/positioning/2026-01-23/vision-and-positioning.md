# Positioning Session — Vision & Positioning — January 23, 2026

---

## Differentiate Discord Positioning (Goal #1)

### What This Actually Means
- Finish updating ALL content to match education-first positioning
- Release Fliff EV filter
- Update community onboarding
- Create responsible gaming section
- Update ticketing system
- Add bot commands for educational tools
- "We need to actually finish doing everything that we say we are"

### The Core Problem
- DD says it's education-first but hasn't fully implemented it across all channels and content
- Need to stop with the "fluff" and actually deliver the educational strategies, tools, and resources

## Staff Culture Adoption (Goal #2)

### What This Looks Like
- Staff need to start using DD's own resources and tools
- Staff should be reacting to messages they find valuable (reactions = "I found value from this")
- Staff need to be re-onboarded on the updated vision
- Staff need contracts and KPIs
- Staff bonus for conversions needs to be established
- Staff must be properly rewarded when they help members succeed

### Historical Problem
- When DD expanded staff with more partnerships, staff weren't given the capability or incentive to convert
- Staff compensation wasn't enough to make it a real priority (independent contractors, part-time)
- Result: decent subscription revenue but poor conversion revenue despite having the partnerships

## Raise Discord Pricing (Goal #3)

### Prerequisites
- OddsJam EV needs to be live — lean heavily on EV as value justification
- All educational resources and partnership tools in place
- Solid community base established
- Messaging: "This is all the value we're now providing — we're no longer just a pick server"

### Strategy
- Target: $50/month
- Grandfather existing members on old pricing
- Free access through partner conversions becomes more attractive at higher price
- Pitch to Alex needed when pricing changes
- Higher price = more server legitimacy + greater partner conversion incentive

## Strengthen Brand Identity (Goal — Q2)

- Evaluate after Q1: Is the education-first vision/mission working?
- What can be done to strengthen it?
- What resources should be added or removed?
- Adjust based on Q1 learnings — this is the iteration phase

## Website Positioning (Goal — Q2)

- Website needs to match Discord positioning
- More SEO presence needed
- More blogs and embedded content
- Currently not enough on the website
- May need more than just formatting — could require full redesign
- Goal: website becomes an organic acquisition source
