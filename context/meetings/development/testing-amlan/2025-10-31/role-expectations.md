# Amlan Onboarding - 2025-10-31 Role Expectations

## Amlan's Role

Part-time developer working on small, well-defined tasks within the existing infrastructure.

## Project Structure

### How Projects Work
1. Dax creates project in Notion with full context
2. Project is broken down into specific tasks
3. Some tasks assigned to Amlan, some to Dax
4. Amlan should have all information needed without asking

### Project Philosophy
- **Small scope** - Not "migrate the website" but "set up the landing page"
- **No blocking** - Amlan should never be waiting on information
- **All context provided** - Everything needed is in the Notion project
- **Back and forth** - Dax and Amlan work collaboratively

### Example Task Flow
1. Dax identifies new EV filters needed (data work)
2. Dax documents the filter criteria
3. Task assigned to Amlan: "When alert matches X criteria, send to channel Y"
4. Amlan implements the code change

## What Amlan Will NOT Be Doing

- Building core infrastructure (already built)
- Large system migrations
- Making data/filter decisions (Dax's domain)
- Anything that requires extensive back-and-forth

## What Amlan WILL Be Doing

- Small feature additions to the EV bot
- Filter implementations (channel routing, criteria matching)
- Potentially website linkage work (connecting pages)
- Code changes within existing bot structure

## Tech Stack to Learn

- **TypeScript** - Bot backend
- **Next.js** - Website backend
- **Framer** - Website frontend (visual builder)
- **Discord.js** - Bot framework
- **Stripe** - Payment processing
- **Notion** - Project management

## Meeting Cadence

### Weekly Sync
- **When:** Fridays at 2pm (tentative, can move)
- **Duration:** ~1 hour
- **Format:** Either work together session OR sync up meeting
- **Location:** In person (Dax's apartment or Launchpad)

### Async Communication
- General dev channel in Discord
- Zack (head developer) available for questions
- Text Dax directly if blocked

## Compensation

- Deferred discussion for 1 month
- Up to 5% equity mentioned
- May convert to per-project payment
- Grace period for both parties to evaluate fit
