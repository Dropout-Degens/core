# Amlan Onboarding - 2025-10-31 Business Context

## What Dropout Degens Does

A sports betting education community that provides:
1. Automated betting alerts (EV bets via bot)
2. Educational resources for members to learn betting strategy
3. Partner referral program for sportsbook signups

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue: Partner Conversions
- Each customer can go through partner links once
- Payout: **$50 to $250 per conversion**
- Customer LTV: **$1,500 to $2,500** (if they go through all partners)
- Realistic capture rate: **10-20%** of total LTV

### Secondary Revenue: Subscriptions
- Subscription model exists but is not the priority
- Freemium approach: Partner signups grant 7-day free access
- Goal is to subsidize free access through partner revenue

### Why This Works
- Exclusive data access from OddsJam (founder relationship)
- No other community has this level of access
- ~1,500 betting alerts sent per day
- 2+ years of historical data collected

## Data Partners

### OddsJam
- Provides positive EV betting opportunities
- Massive algorithm scanning every line/market combination
- Sends predictions via email → parsed by bot → sent to Discord

### DailyGrandFantasy
- Additional betting data source
- Same email parsing system

## Growth Strategy

- Currently **8,000 members** (purely organic growth)
- No paid acquisition to date
- Positioned through Discord link sharing
- New hires coming:
  - Head of Marketing (investing own money)
  - Head of Community Engagement (bringing existing community)

## Competitive Differentiation

- Most sports betting communities: "Here's what to bet"
- Dropout Degens: "Here's the data AND the knowledge to do it yourself"
- Focus on knowledge transfer, not just picks
- Building systems for members to become self-sufficient

## Legal Considerations

- Sports betting has legal restrictions
- Dax is under 21
- Using partner data requires careful handling
- International student work restrictions may apply to Amlan
