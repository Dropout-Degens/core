# Nanu Ongoing Expectations — As of February 1, 2026

---

## Role

Prospective Moderator (pending workload assessment and welcome ticket system fix)

## Background

Nanu is starting a 9-5 job on February 2nd. He'll be in-person three days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) and working from home the other days. He expects low workload until June, especially during work-from-home days. He splits time between two states (likely New York and Connecticut), neither of which has good DD partner availability.

He's turning 21 on February 16th and plans to sign up for all the legal sportsbooks using DD referral codes.

## Current Status

**On hold for ~1 week** while:
1. Nanu assesses his actual job workload
2. The welcome ticket system gets fixed

If both check out, Nanu will be formalized as a moderator. In the meantime, he has all-access with staff perks and should focus on community engagement.

## Expected Availability

- **Evenings:** 7pm-10pm after work
- **Commute:** Couple hours on train
- **Work from home days:** Significant downtime expected, can be active during the day
- **Weekends:** Ample time

Most server joins happen during 9-5 hours, which aligns with Nanu's work-from-home availability.

## Expected Responsibilities (Once Mod Role is Confirmed)

- **Welcome tickets:** Respond to new member tickets, help them find value in the Discord and partners
- **Community engagement:** Be active in chats, especially during commute and WFH downtime
- **Partner visibility:** Share screenshots of tools when researching plays to drive awareness
- **Conversions:** Help convert members onto partners through education and natural recommendation

## Compensation

- **5% bonus pool:** Distributed based on conversion points earned
- **Points system:** Each partner has a point value. Nanu earns points for:
  - Converting someone onto a partner (they use DD's code)
  - Inviting someone who later converts (tracked via invite link)
  - Double points if he both invites AND converts the same person
- **Requirement:** Must get at least one conversion to receive any payout
- **Start date:** February

## Tool Access (Pending)

Dax will provide company accounts for:
- OddsJam
- Daily Grind Fantasy
- Outlier
- Other tools as available

## Unique Considerations

- Both of Nanu's states have limited partner availability (NY banned Fliff/Thrills, CT has few options)
- Turning 21 on Feb 16 — will gain access to FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, etc.
- Has experience with Pickett (bet tracking) and prefers Google Sheets for tracking
- Interested in the "startup vibes" of getting in at ground zero
