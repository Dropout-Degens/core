# Nanu 1:1 Summary — February 1, 2026

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Nanu (Prospective Mod)
**Purpose:** Schedule review, education-first positioning overview, mod role discussion, compensation structure

---

## Schedule and Availability

Nanu is starting a 9-5 job tomorrow (February 2nd). He'll be in-person three days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) and working from home the other days. Outside of the 40-hour workweek, he has ample time. He mentioned he's interested in helping with something that has "startup type vibes" and wants to get in at ground zero.

His available hours for DD engagement:
- **Evenings:** 7pm to 10pm-ish after work
- **Commute:** A couple hours on the train where he could chat in Discord
- **Work from home days:** Expects to have significant downtime, especially in the first few weeks/months (until June) while workload is light
- **Weekends:** Ample time, just goes to the gym

Dax noted that most server joins happen during 9-5 hours (5:57am, 8am, 10am, 11am, 4:40pm), which is when mod ticket responses would be most needed. Nanu said he should be able to handle this, especially when working from home with his setup and low workload.

## State Restrictions

Both Nanu and Dax are in states with limited sports betting options. Nanu splits time between two states (likely New York and Connecticut based on context), neither of which has good partner availability for DD.

Nanu currently uses FanDuel the most because of their boosts and promotions. He's turning 21 on February 16th and is excited to sign up for all the legal sportsbooks. Dax mentioned the sign-up bonuses (DraftKings ~$200, FanDuel ~$200-300, Fanatics free $50 plus more).

Nanu said he'll use DD referral codes when he signs up — he has a list of people who've asked him to use their codes and will use Dax's code for at least one app.

New York banned Fliff and Thrills, which Nanu discovered when he redownloaded Fliff and found he couldn't use it.

## Education-First Positioning

Dax walked through the company's three stages:
- **Year 1:** Scaled community from 0 to ~3,000 members, landed first 1-3 partnerships
- **Year 2:** Expanded partnerships from a few to 25, but failed to scale conversions
- **Year 3:** Switching to education-first positioning — teaching strategies, resources, and how to use them

The framing shift: instead of just giving picks, DD wants to be the "teaching ground" where members learn concepts, understand tools, and eventually sign up for partners using DD's code when they're ready.

Dax used the example of Sweater asking in general chat why someone's odds were 30 and his were 21 — that's a conversion opportunity to teach line shopping and get someone onto a new sportsbook.

## Mod Role Discussion

Dax proposed a moderator role focused on welcome tickets — every new user who joins will get a ticket that mods answer and message in. However, the welcome ticket system is currently broken (was supposed to be fixed in a meeting with Zach on Saturday but Dax overslept and missed it).

Dax was hesitant to over-commit Nanu given the new job. He offered an alternative: Nanu could stay in an all-access role with staff perks and focus on community engagement rather than formal mod responsibilities.

Nanu said he thinks he can handle the mod role, especially with work-from-home downtime. They agreed to wait about a week for:
1. Nanu to understand his actual workload at the new job
2. The welcome ticket system to get fixed

## Compensation — Points System

Dax explained the conversion-based compensation:

- **5% bonus fund** distributed to all staff based on conversion points
- **Points per partner:** Each partner has a point value (e.g., Optimal = 3 points, Pickett = 1 point, WannaParlay = 5 points)
- **Example:** If the 5% bonus = $100 and Nanu gets 3 points while Dax gets 1 point, Nanu gets $75 and Dax gets $25
- **Tracked invite links:** Everyone Nanu invites is tracked. If someone he invited converts, Nanu gets points for that conversion too.
- **Double points:** If Nanu both invites someone AND converts them onto a partner, he gets points for both (e.g., 5 + 5 = 10 points for a WannaParlay conversion)

Conversions are tracked via the partner attribution channel — screenshot of the person + partner name.

Dax emphasized: "The only thing is you need to get a conversion if you want to get paid."

## Tools and Bot Features

Dax showed several bot features:

- **Partner promo bot:** Input state/age, shows available partners. Connecticut showed ProfitX and incorrectly showed Onyx (needs updating).
- **Odds converter:** Input American, decimal, or implied probability, get conversions
- **Arbitrage calculator:** Input bet 1 odds and stake, tells you bet 2 stake for guaranteed profit
- **Parlay calculator:** Input legs, calculates payout. Integrates with bankroll bot for unit sizing.

Dax offered to give Nanu access to company accounts for tools (OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy, etc.) so he can take screenshots when sharing plays.

## EV Bot Status

The Fliff EV bot exists and was up ~38 units from 167 plays, but it's currently broken — sending to wrong channels. Needs a call with Bellcube to fix. Once live, it'll help drive engagement and conversions by showing which book plays are on.

## Bet105

Dax showed Bet105, an offshore book that works in restricted states. It's crypto deposit with a $5 minimum. Nanu said he'd check it out after the call. Dax mentioned he likes the guys they work with there.

Nanu showed he had placed a bet on 1/13/2025 and then his next one on 2/1/2026 (today). They briefly discussed some NHL bets — Nanu had a bad beat where the Red Wings scored first but it got called back, then the Capitals won.

## Next Steps

- Dax to send Nanu a tracked invite link after the call
- Dax to send documentation formalizing the compensation structure in a couple days
- Dax to give Nanu access to Routine (company workspace) once view-only permissions are ready
- Dax to provide company tool accounts (OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy, etc.)
- Wait ~1 week for Nanu to assess his job workload and for welcome tickets to be fixed
- Compensation starts February — need at least one conversion to get paid
