# Business Context — As of February 1, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is repositioning from a picks-focused Discord to an education-first sports betting community. The company has been through three stages:

- **Year 1:** Scaled from 0 to ~3,000 members, landed first 1-3 partnerships
- **Year 2:** Expanded partnerships to 25, but failed to scale conversions proportionally
- **Year 3:** Switching to education-first positioning — teaching strategies, resources, and how to use tools

The core problem: DD grew partnerships but didn't convert members onto those partnerships. The subscription is only $15/month while partnerships pay ~$50 per sign-up CPA. The focus now is on driving conversions through education.

## Team

- **Dax (CEO):** Managing everything. Missed a Saturday meeting with Zach because he stayed up too late Friday.
- **Zach (Developer):** Handles bot development. Welcome tickets and Fliff EV bot are both broken and waiting on fixes.
- **JP (Mod):** Active mod, handles tickets and daily poll.
- **Nanu (Prospective):** Being onboarded on this call. Starting a 9-5 job, will assess workload before confirming mod role.
- **Other staff:** Mentioned but not detailed.

## Revenue

- Subscription: $15/month (unchanged, though increase to $50/month has been discussed)
- Partnership CPA: ~$50 per sign-up on average
- Current LTV per customer: ~$1,300 across all partnerships
- Projected LTV after new partnerships: ~$1,800
- Projected LTV after legal sportsbooks (when Dax turns 21): ~$2,500

## Product State

- **Welcome tickets:** Broken. Set up ~1.5-2 weeks ago but not working. Was supposed to be fixed in a Saturday meeting but Dax overslept.
- **Fliff EV bot:** Broken — sending to wrong channels. Up ~38 units from 167 plays when it was working. Needs Bellcube to fix.
- **Partner promo bot:** Working but needs updates (Onyx incorrectly showing for Connecticut).
- **Bot calculators:** Working — odds converter, arbitrage calculator, parlay calculator with bankroll integration.
- **Routine (company workspace):** Being populated. Staff will get view-only access once permissions are ready.

## Partnerships

- 25 current partnerships
- Most staff are in restricted states (NY, CT) with limited partner access
- Legal sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics, MGM) coming when Dax turns 21 (Feb 16)
- Bet105 available as offshore option for restricted states

## Compensation Structure

- **5% bonus pool** for all staff, distributed by conversion points
- Points vary by partner (e.g., Optimal = 3, Pickett = 1, WannaParlay = 5)
- Points earned for: direct conversions, invite-based conversions (tracked links), or both (double points)
- Tracked via partner attribution channel — screenshot + partner name
- Starts February — must have at least one conversion to get paid

## Strategic Direction

1. Fix broken systems (welcome tickets, Fliff EV)
2. Get staff set up with tool accounts and tracked invite links
3. Drive partner visibility through screenshots and natural conversation
4. Convert the education into partnership sign-ups
5. Add legal sportsbooks once Dax turns 21

## Key Blockers

- Welcome ticket system broken
- Fliff EV bot broken (wrong channel)
- Most staff in restricted states with limited partner access
- Developer availability (Zach) — meetings getting missed
