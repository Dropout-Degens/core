Uh, er, no. and an AI note taker just to-It makes me a little bit easier to get all my notes together later. Yeah, you're good. uh... Just To kind of set a little bit of an agenda just like First, just walk me through what your schedule looks like and what you're thinking in terms of when it comes to helping out around dropout degens. And then I'll walk you through a little bit of what we're thinking about going.

And then we'll find that middle ground of what would work best. Yeah, sounds good. Basically, I start off my 95 from tomorrow. So in person three times a week, mainly like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. That's what I'm thinking.

And other than that, it's just taking another table of 40 hours. Outside of that, I don't have much going on right now. We just had a set of conferences I'd like to... I'm not saying such like dropout like BJ and stuff like that. Way to help. And I'm kind of curious how much... Because I know you said you want to make the activist stuff like that. I don't know. It seems kind of interesting to get ground zero and just work like a startup type vibes to it.

It kind of seems interesting. But... How do you really need help, really? I've got probably ample amount of time to give a little feedback, but like, seven when I commute so got a couple hours for another bed anyways Yeah, so it would be like that little...

like seven to like 10 ish time yeah so yeah so yeah yeah and then maybe if you're not like busy on your commute over on the train you could like chop up in some of the chats Oh, 100%.

100%. Yeah. I probably have my laptop. Especially if I'm working. When I work from home, especially the first couple weeks, I don't have much workload. Like when I'm at home, I probably have ample amount of time.

Yeah. All right. Awesome. Awesome. Good to know on that note.

Yeah. So schedule is every time weekends, ample amount of time already on the weekends, like just to gym.

Yeah. Yeah. And then. Oh, wait. So I was about to say you're in actually two states, but they're both like shitty sports betting states. Like for our partners wise.

Like I don't have any access to anything. And I know you don't have access to anything either. Oh, yeah. The legal ones. But yeah, like Fanatics, DraftKings and FanDuel.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which out of those do you use the most? Thanks. Not really. I feel like I use...

FanUil for summer just because they have those boosts and stuff. Yeah. They have more good promotions in my opinion than the other books.

I'm like, steaming to get on theI can't wait. Oh my gosh.

yeah yeah no that first month when you get all those promotions dog oh my gosh it was amazing look at it i'm gonna get real good because i know draft drafting gives you like 200 fan duel gives you like either 200 300 now okay and fanatic fanatic gives you a free 50 plus more options beautiful that's actually insanely beautiful Yeah, that's how I made my 500 back so fast that I lost.

Nice. I'm going to be all over. I'm going to get every single app. So it's like... Yeah, I'll use your, I'll use, I have to get together like a list of everybody who's asked me to use their code and then. Oh yeah, I understand, yeah, yeah.

And then I'll be like, all right, which app do you want me to use your code for? It's like, but yeah, I'll figure it out and I'll definitely use your code for at least one. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. But no, it's going to be great.

You said two weeks, right? Yeah, on the 16th. Oh, let's go. Let's go. Yeah, it's a Monday, which sucks, but it'll be great.

Hey, I was downloading that shit 12:00 like 12:05 I was a fiend.

I already have them all downloaded, so it's just like, I gotta make a new account now.

Yeah, I didn't bother making my stuff before age because I know people got like blockings all day.

Yeah, can't risk it. I'm already going to get maybe like limited, but like I hope not. Because I'm going to try to arb and I'm going to try to like, I don't even know. But it'll be fun. But kind of to swing it back to dropout degens-ish. Yep, yep. What we're trying to do positioning-wise is like... I guess to kind of give you a rundown of the... how we've looked at things operationally. We've kind of like, so our first year we scaled our community growth.

So we had like no members and we scaled to about like 3000. That helped us land our first like one to three partnerships. And from there in year two, we just branched off those few partnerships and expanded our base to like 25. Yeah. And so the issue was that we weren't converting. And so we haven't changed. We haven't raised that. We did once, but it wasn't. We just dropped it down after like a month or two.

But we only charge $15 a month for our subscriptions. And our partnerships basically revenue on average about $50 per sign up. And so we have about $25. So we have about LTV wise about $1,800 in customer value currently. It's going to go up to like $2,500. Actually, I think it's $1,300 right now. And it's going to be $1,800 after... if we sign all these partnerships I'm talking to. After the legal books, it'll be in that 2500 range and so Basically, what we failed to do when we grow our partnerships was to just grow the amount we were converting.

Yep. So that's where we're kind of switching to. And just... we're changing our positioning to be more education focused, to be like, these are the strategies, these are the resources, and these are how you use them. And that's how we're kind of going to frame our community. And then on top of that, with our partnerships, we're going to use the aspect of, we have the Discord integrations with basically all of our current partners, or the tool partners.

And so, What we're going to do is basically we want to have the framing of you can learn how to actually use this partner, use this concept, understand it, and then eventually you can go use that website if you like it on your own. We want to be that teaching ground.

So.

So, and, like, the runaround on that is they're going to use our code later on in the future when they sign up for the partner. Of course. And then the second thing to that is just, like, the sharing and visibility of our current partners. So, like, for example, the... I'll just use Onyx as an example because I love Onyx, but they're bad. But like... For example, the more we send screenshots of ONIX, just the better it is for us to get conversions onto that app because people are just like, oh, what is that app?

Oh, it's ONIX, and we can show them and have them use our code through that way. And then also, we can also have the benefit of just teaching our members how to line shop. The one example I'll use, and I think I actually forgot to respond in general chat, Thank you. but the guys, uh, yeah. Sweater said, how's yours 30 and his 21. And, um, like basically that's the whole aspect of like, that's a conversion right there onto a partnership.

Um, Oh yes.

Yes. Um, I didn't to him cause he's broke.

Um, So he wouldn't deposit and we wouldn't get a CPA yet. But... He's a free dollar user. I gave him another app that he hasn't deposited on. That's like... Our lives, great. Yeah, but basically the whole aspect is that's what we're trying to do. We're focusing on our partnerships. And so it's just not only about using the tools and like sending, for example, do you have any of those tools?

Not anymore. I used to have, like, Outlier for sure.

Okay, so what I can do is I can give you access to, like, one of our accounts. I'll have to get together, like, who I give my accounts to, so I'll let you know in a little bit what I have access to and, like, what I can give out. But, like, I have company accounts for basically all of the websites there. Odds Jam, Daily Grind Fantasy. Props Cash is a bitch. They don't give me one, but I could basically pay.

Give everybody access to it. Yeah, yeah.

I always think Pickett's the longest time. Pickett was good.

Yeah, Pickett's good. Oh, no, fuck Pickett, though, because their pro is...

99 bucks so oh shit fuck that Their free was good though when I was using it back in the day.

Yeah, back in the day I used to love them, but I don't love them that much anymore.

Yeah, I just use my Excel sheet if I'm putting in money.

Yeah, I love my Google Sheets. But that's kind of the positioning and the framing. And then the second thing that I'll just put on top of that, and so I guess depending on your availability to be in the staff, team and so like I'm not too sure because White right now with the staff team Or like I would be thinking for you. I would I would put you in a moderator role if you were to be on the staff team But I would kind of right now I'm gonna be creating welcome tickets.

So every single user who joins the server Will get a ticket that the mods are going to like answer and message in. Yep, go ahead. So, like, depending on, like, how you think, like, with your work schedule, because, like, it would mostly be people joining in. Like, all of our joins are 5.57 a.m., 8, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 4.40. Yeah, in the morning.

Like, they're, like, times 9 to 5. So, like, I don't– because there's two things we need is, like, one is just, like, the actual, like, community that we need.

community base of knowledgeable, educated bettors, like even if they're not on our analyst team, but like to be in the chats for like members we require to come into. But We also like need that engagement from like just the general all access members that we don't have right now. So like, I guess like, Would like would that one thing like I would say if you Wouldn't be able to commit to to that much of, like, being able to answer those mod tickets.

Would you be able to, like, be, just stay in the all-access role? But we'll give you, I'll give you the staff perks. But we just, like, need that all-access kind of community engagement aspect, if that makes sense.

Yeah, I got you, I got you. Look, I should be able to be active in this, especially because if I'm working from home, I have, like, my setup right now, and I'll probably have a lot of downtime until June anyway. to be active during the day when I'm working from home.

to like answer these messages and on the weekends, yada, yada.

Okay, so you actually think you would be able to?

Yeah, I think I should be able to.

Okay, because that was, that's like the main thing that I wouldn't want to give you the responsibility, right? And so, like, also, let me just tell you the second thing is, we set them up like... a week and a half ago but they're broken and they've been supposed to be working for the past like week and a half two weeks oh shit um we were supposed to have a develop i was supposed to meet with zach on um fucking saturday morning but i stayed up so late on friday and i stopped for a meeting and then we didn't get it fixed um so with the support tickets like it's not something that um is actually live yet um so i guess like do you want to Like, Do you want to just, like, wait for...

Yeah, yeah, no rush.

Yeah, no rush. Yeah, exactly, exactly. Fair enough.

And, like, I don't want you to, like... feel committed to like be in the mod role and answer those messages when you don't have the time and like I don't want to like over commit you when you know what I mean Yeah, no, I get you.

Yeah, that's also fair. Yeah, waiting a week is probably great so I can get a hang of actually what my workload is going to be. I don't foresee it being too much based on where my meeting was with my manager a couple weeks ago, at least until June, just because I'm starting early anyways.

Yeah, like, I know how the little, like, the silly week of, or, like, the silly two months of, like, your internship is.

Yeah, mine? Yeah, mine was like a week for that, which is great, because I got so bored with having nothing to do. That's nice.

I had, like, a whole month of acclimation. It was kind of, like, kind of, like, boring, but it was kind of nice. But, like, just, like, that, like, calm period before the storm. Yeah, exactly.

Exactly.

But okay, so what, What I'll do is I'll basically and so with the mod rules so how payments work with the the mod team is There's kind of two things is You'll get both an invite link. I'll give you like we have our own server invite links. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. So we'll track everybody that you invite in the server.

So there's two things that come about that is as a moderator and as like a member, if you convert anybody onto all of our partners, and this is the biggest part about like using the being able to use the partners um and when we get like when we get fanatics and vandal and like everything as a partner it'll be so much easier for you um but like you gotta wait like two two weeks uh so if you gotta get people on the flip you gotta get people on the flip or like um yeah um but like the biggest part is um just like With using, if you're the one using it, say example, you send a screenshot of thrills and nobody knows what thrills is because it's been like a while since they've seen it.

So if you're the one that says, hey, use our dropouts code and they do it, then you'll get points. And let me pull up a screen share for this real quick. Okay. I will give you access to this in a little bit. Right now I need to finalize the content and then also get team sharing in a view only. Because right now you guys can all edit and that would be a little scary because it takes so much time to get.

It's a very new software. But it's not a problem. Just like a notes and calendar app, but basically I have all of our partners loaded up in here. And so this is the same thing if you were to go into just our resources and our partners, it would be just all of these. Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. And so the basically These are the same And what I did here is I put a point system. And so I'm going to have a basically 5% bonus fund that goes to all of the staff.

And it's going to be based on how many conversions you get. And so I'm just going to use an example of it's 5% and we make whatever. The bonus, the 5% is equal to $100. And so there are two people, me and you in it. get just one conversion but you get it on for example our partner optimal which is three points and I get it on pick it which is one point so you would get 75% of that hundred dollars so $75 I would get $25 And then it kind of just scales up as both you get more conversions um and then as we get more as a whole year so it's like both increased by yourself and increased by the team that overall fun yep yep yep And then...

Um... There's a second thing.

I don't know why I'm just blanking. Like I think it Oh, oh, so and so with the points, this goes back to your link. So. What we're going to do is we have a staff channel that is just partner attribution. So if you get somebody to sign up for a... partner and the whole format of that for them is that they'll open a free access support ticket and eventually we'll make this so that we have our partner probably about right here but we'll build it out so that they'll claim everything and then submit a request right to the spot so one whole thing but right now it'll be manual but basically they'll create a ticket they'll say hey i signed up for x partner here's a screenshot And so you just say, hey, this is the person and they signed up for the ex-partner.

So if they signed up for want to parlay, they get you get five points for that. And so the thing is with. Tagging the user is important is because who invited that user so if you were the one that invited that user Then you also get five points for that conversion.

Oh, yeah, people So it's like a failure essentially.

Yep. So it's both a bonus for, and so if you were the one to both invite the person and then convert them onto the partner, you'll get 10 points for that. And then if you invited them and then I converted them, you would still get five points for that.

Got you, got you. Okay, okay.

So. Any questions on that?

No, that makes sense. Just like... Getting people using the partnerships, which is important.

Yeah, and so I guess like the easiest the best way for you to do this will be to like one use the partners and like I I would just suggest that, yeah, Flip is good for now until we get our social sports books.

But I guess, like, the other big thing would maybe be, like, if you do research any plays, like, I know you probably do mostly, like, hand research and just, like, what you like. But if I were to get you, like, an account on anywhere or something, like, even if you, like, hand research, just, like, look at it on a thing and just take a screenshot and send it. Oh, yeah.

Yeah, of course, of course. And that would be really amazing.

Yeah. Yeah, of course. Of course. Pack it up.

And then that's, yeah. And that's basically just mostly it on the positioning. And then what I'll do is it won't be this week. And then also this starts for February. So it's just like the only thing is you need to get a conversion if you want to get paid. Yes, of course. So I'll both send you a link after this. And then in about like a couple days, I'll send you over some documentation that just formalizes all the information that I said here and also just Uh...

gives you access to the points so you can see who you want to try most for. And then I think yeah that's mostly it on what we're trying to do with our updates we'll have our Eevee released soon like I'm still working to the data but mostly just like I reset this channel so this is what our old EV looked like And we basically, I think it's up like 40 or 30 units, which is not bad. Yeah, 38 from a total of, I think it's 150.

Not bad.

Yeah.

Yeah, 167 notifications. So not bad overall. I mean, it's pretty like hot streaks in here too. Oh, wow.

Yeah.

Yeah, like it can get pretty hot so... That's what I'm trying to set up again, and so that'll be we have flip released again It's just a developmental issue where it's being sent in the wrong channels right now, so it's not live But it'll be live as soon as I can get on a call with bell cube to get it fixed but And that'll be another way that we'll be helping to get more people to speak.

Because it shows the book it's on, of course.

Exactly. That's a little sneaky extra way. Yeah, yeah. Oh, and then one last thing I'll show you is where... We're building a couple more bot features. where basically I can't actually, because these are in development environment right now, but basically you input your odds and if it's American decimal or implied probability, and it gives you just the conversion. Oh, interesting.

Yeah, that's one calculator we have. So I find it really, I love it for just like, I want to find the implied probability of things. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's one of the tools I built here. There's an arbitrage calculator. So you just put in your bet one, if it's the odds, how much you put on it, and it'll tell you how much it pays, and then just tell you how much your second bet is.

Oh, nice. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then you just put in the odds for this, and then it tells you how much to stake, and then just stake... Yeah, for sure. That much for that much to get a guaranteed profit of that much. It'll also tell you if it's bad too, which is pretty nice. And then we have this parlay calculator, which is basically you put in your parlay as many legs as you want. and it calculates. If you've used the bankroll bot, this is why I wanted you to use it earlier, it'll take this.

And so right now the wager amount is one unit, But if you have your bankroll set up, it'll adjust the bankroll, the unit size to say units, which is pretty cool.

Nice, nice. Yeah, yeah, I see that.

Um. And then, yeah, so we're basically just building out the bots. You've seen the partner promo bot, I think, but basically you tell it your state, and Let's pressCan I take it real quick?

Yep, yep, yep.

Bye. and it tells you what is available for you. So you have profit X. That actually might be a valid, Oh, interesting.

Wait, Onyx is not working Connecticut, I swear. Yeah, they don't.

I haven't updated this. No, you're good.

You're good. I don't know about Prophex, though.

Let me check that out.

Yeah, Connecticut. Oh, except that's up.

That's up. Never mind. I don't have access to like flip rails. Any of, I think New York does. Right. Do you have access to flipping thrills? No, they banned them.

Like, like, In New York too?

Yeah, like a little bit of gums. Like I was so mad. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Because I was going to say, how did I get my internship? Because when I was there, I didn't realize it. So I deleted it, but I randomly redownloaded it. Oh, shit. I have a free dollar. Yeah, it sucks.

There's actually nothing. I have one set in my wallet. What is this?

Oh, this app. I feel like I used this before.

Yeah, they used to be legal in New York, but I guess...

I don't even think it's major.

Cam's put me on to this, I remember, if I remember correctly. Yeah, probably. On himself. Oh my gosh, I can't even place that. Drake May. Yeah. Oh, it's available in all 40 states except the ones we need it to be?

Yeah, it's so annoying.

I need to update that. Layup? One app you actually do have is, oh yeah, you have Layup. If you want to try an offshore, this is one that I'm using right now.

The IO5?

Yeah, bet105.ag.

Yeah, I was looking at that. I was looking at the promo stuff. I actually haven't checked that out at all. So I'm checking that right now. I'll just go after the call ball real quickly and pull it up right now.

Yeah, they're... They're, uh... They're pretty good. They have the same UI as some... funded account website. I don't remember which one, but they're pretty neat. I like the guys that we work with, so I put them back up.

We've gotten...

I don't remember if it's a free 25 or if it's...

I have to deposit $5.

Yeah. Yeah.

But... It's pretty good. That's what I did. I placed the bet on 1-13-2025. And then I placed my next one on 2-1-2026.

Oh, shit. Good stuff. So, yeah. Oh, today. What the hell you meant today? Oh, next?

Yeah. Hey.

Yeah but Um... I mean, this is crazy for...

Oh yeah, yesterday. Yeah.

That was so crazy. And today I, um... I lost cuz Um. The hurricanes didn't cover. Shit. Actually, yesterday, I can't believe this hit.

Sick website though. Yeah, this is my friend's bookie.

I'm literally going to not use it anymore after this. Bye. But I missed this one.

It got called off too.

The Red Wings scored first and they were up 1-0. And then I got another notification on Reel that the Capitals scored. And I was like, oh my god, that cashed that shit. And then I looked and it was 1-0 Capitals because they called back the Red Wings goal and they did score again. So brutal. That's so annoying. And then that's the night. Oh my gosh, wait. Oh, this is so bad. The, um... The, where is it?

Is this Thursday?

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, January.

the Look at this game tying goal 92 feet.

Wow.

This is how they brought it back to overtime. They scored two within like, um, uh, like 15 minutes.

Perfect defensive play by Dowd.

To Brinkett, rims it around, bad balls in front, where is it? It's in! Score!

We are tied! Yeah, but I had Red Wings money.

And they lost in the shootout, which sucks. What's the code? The code's dropouts.

Yes, sir.

You know what I do realize? I've been seeing other pages, fucking Twitter. Twitter big.
