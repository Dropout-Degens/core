# Nanu — Current Context

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026
**Role:** Prospective Moderator
**Status:** On hold — assessing job workload, waiting for welcome tickets to be fixed

---

## Background

Nanu started a 9-5 job on February 2, 2026. He's in-person three days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday) and working from home the other days. He expects low workload until June, especially on WFH days. He splits time between two states (likely New York and Connecticut), neither of which has good DD partner availability.

He's turning 21 on February 16th and plans to sign up for all the legal sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, Fanatics) using DD referral codes.

He mentioned being interested in the "startup vibes" of getting in at ground zero.

## Current Status

**On hold for ~1 week** while:
1. Nanu assesses his actual job workload
2. The welcome ticket system gets fixed

Once both are resolved, Nanu will be formalized as a moderator. In the meantime, he has all-access with staff perks.

## Availability

- **Evenings:** 7pm-10pm after work
- **Commute:** Couple hours on train — can chat in Discord
- **Work from home days:** Significant downtime expected, can be active during the day
- **Weekends:** Ample time (just gym)

Most server joins happen during 9-5 hours, which aligns with his WFH availability.

## Expected Responsibilities (Once Confirmed)

- **Welcome tickets:** Respond to new member tickets
- **Community engagement:** Be active in chats
- **Partner visibility:** Share screenshots of tools when researching plays
- **Conversions:** Help convert members onto partners through education

## Compensation

- **5% bonus pool:** Distributed based on conversion points
- **Points system:** Each partner has a point value. Earns points for conversions and invite-based referrals. Double points if he both invites AND converts someone.
- **Requirement:** Must get at least one conversion to receive any payout
- **Start date:** February

## Tool Access (Pending)

Dax will provide company accounts for OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy, Outlier, etc.

## Unique Considerations

- Both states have limited partner availability (NY banned Fliff/Thrills, CT has few options)
- Turning 21 on Feb 16 — will gain access to major sportsbooks
- Has experience with Pickett, prefers Google Sheets for tracking
- Checked out Bet105 as offshore option during the call
