**Purpose:** Capacity check-in, education-first pivot walkthrough, roadmap overview, role alignment

---

## Capacity

JP is currently working five days a week (10am-7pm shifts), off Wednesday and Thursday. Very limited availability for DD until January 12th, when he starts a new hospital job (patient admitting, graveyard shift 11pm-7am). After January 12th, JP will have daytime availability for Discord engagement.

## Education-First Pivot

Dax walked JP through the company's shift from a picks-focused server to an education-first community. The core positioning change: instead of "here are the profitable picks for today," the framing becomes "here is how we found profitable picks today and how you can apply it yourself." Members should be equipped with resources and knowledge to fact-check analyst picks and find their own bets using integrated tools (OddsJam, Props Cache, Outlier, Daily Grind Fantasy optimizer).

The vision is that members carry knowledge from every bet regardless of outcome — understanding which trends to follow, which markets to target, and when they simply got unlucky.

## Roadmap

Dax presented a wave-based roadmap:

- **Wave 1 (by January 1st):** Staff onboarding, Discord content updates, Fliff EV live, invite link refresh, Discord cleanup, responsible gaming section
- **Wave 2 (January-February):** Retention and conversion features — partner promo bot, individualized ticket system (server welcome tickets, premium walkthrough tickets, free access tickets), pricing increase to $50/month
- **Wave 3 (post-February):** Community re-engagement, potential Discord acquisition, scaling through social media and paid growth

## JP's Role

JP's mod responsibilities will center on the ticket system once it's built out in Wave 2-3. When new members join, mods get pinged to welcome them and provide personalized support. JP's increased availability after January 12th aligns with when the ticket system will be most relevant.

## Revenue Model

Dax explained the partnership LTV model: $1,200-$1,500 per customer in total, increasing to ~$2,000 when Dax turns 21. At $1/customer acquisition cost, only 2% conversion rate needed to break even. This makes paid growth sustainable once the conversion funnel is in place.

## Key Decisions

- JP confirmed as mod (not analyst) given capacity constraints
- Minimal expectations until January 12th job transition
- Ticket system responsibilities will ramp up as features are built
