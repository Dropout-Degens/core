## Current Expectations (Dec 26 - Jan 12)

- Minimal. JP's current job schedule (10am-7pm, five days/week) leaves almost no capacity.
- No hard KPIs set for this period.

## Post-January 12th Expectations

- **Ticket management:** Respond to server welcome tickets and support tickets when pinged. Shared responsibility across mod team — not solely JP's load.
- **Community engagement:** Be present in Discord during daytime hours. Welcome new members, provide personalized support, help members find value in tools and partnerships.
- **Education-first framing:** When recommending partners or tools, frame it around the member's specific need and the educational value — not as a sales push.
- **Conversion support:** Help facilitate partner conversions through the ticket system when it's live. This is where commission-based compensation comes from.

## Compensation

Commission-based, tied to conversion points. Structure to be formalized — trial period in January, first official commission payments starting February.
