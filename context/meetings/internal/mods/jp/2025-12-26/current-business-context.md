# Business Context — As of December 26, 2025

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is in the middle of a strategic pivot from a picks-focused Discord to an education-first sports betting community. The pivot is not yet reflected in the Discord — content, channels, and onboarding have not been updated to match the new positioning. Wave 1 target is January 1st for all educational content and Discord updates to be in place.

## Team

- Dax (CEO) — managing everything, balancing full-time job and school
- JP — mod, currently very low capacity due to job schedule, transitioning to new job January 12th
- Dante — analyst, activity level unclear at this point
- Limited active staff overall; server engagement is low

## Revenue

- Subscription revenue is minimal
- No partnership revenue being actively collected at this time
- LTV per customer estimated at $1,200-$1,500 across all partnerships, expected to increase to ~$2,000 when Dax turns 21
- Break-even on paid acquisition: 2% conversion rate at $1/customer

## Product State

- Fliff EV is scheduled to go live for the education pivot (not yet live)
- Partner promo bot exists but is not fully built out
- Ticket system (server welcome, premium walkthrough, free access) planned but not yet implemented
- Tools integrated: OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy, Props Cache, Outlier — but members are not actively being directed to use them

## Key Blockers

- Developer availability (Zach) limiting feature development pace
- Staff engagement is low — correlates with founder's limited availability
- Discord does not yet reflect the education-first positioning
- No active conversion funnel in place yet

## Strategic Direction

Finish the education-first pivot (Wave 1), then build retention and conversion features (Wave 2), then scale through re-engagement and acquisition (Wave 3). Do not focus on old member re-engagement yet — prioritize getting the community ready so new members have something to come into.
