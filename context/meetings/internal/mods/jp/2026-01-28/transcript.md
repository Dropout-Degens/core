3 to 11, 8 hours?

Yeah, but on Monday, I worked on... I worked like a 13-hour shift on Monday.

13 hours?

Yeah, because so it was the blizzard on Monday or Sunday, right? And then so like half of my team called out. So I had to stay from 11... PM to 3 PM the next day.

Oh, nah. That's brutal.

And then I had to come back The next day, and do a seven to three.

Oh, that's early. Yeah, that's what it is.

But, um, yeah, that's my, that's me.

Did you get a lot of snow?

Yeah, my... My door was snowed in like I had to climb through the fucking window and to shovel that shit out You had to climb through a window? Yes, I had to climb through one of my windows to shovel my door out.

Oh no, that's so funny.

We had like...

Probably like 8 inches, so we had a lot but it was It was manageable.

And then it was so annoying trying to get my car out of the fucking snow. I was pissed off. Because every time I would finish my driveway and these stupid sanitation drivers would just... Push it back in.

Oh, no.

Like, you don't see me doing shit here?

That's awful.

But, um... Yeah. Also, my February schedule dropped.

If you do want to see it, Yeah, I would definitely. I'll take your February schedule.

Hold on. How do we do this? One second. Thank you. Here, let me just... Share my screen. It's easier. Go for it. Do you see it? My screen.

Yeah, but I have no idea what I'm looking at. Oh, wait, no. John Hopland. Yep, that's... Yeah.

This is starting February 2nd. It's for the whole month. This is my schedule.

7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Yeah.

Yeah, this is until 2 to 6.

Okay, wait. Let me actually just mark this mic. calendar, uh Anyway. Okay, so this is the week of the second. So create a new. My calendar is breaking. Okay, cool. JP works 7A to 3P.

And then this is for the The following week. On this, I work a double here. And I low-key regret accepting that double, but you know it's what it is.

Oh, 12am to 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.?

Yeah, wait, this is the week of 9 to 13. Yeah, because...

Oh, that's an overnight tour.

Wait, no. So from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m., I have to go to a class that I need to take. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. That sucks. And then I come back and then I have a 3 to 11 shift.

That's that is, yeah, I wouldn't, you would not catch me at that shift.

Yeah. You know, that's what you get for working at a hospital, you know? Yeah. And then 12 to 8 is that Friday. So I'm off Wednesday. Not really, but... Kinda. And then this is for the, this is, The next week. 16. This virtual training, don't know what time it is. So... They said they'll let me know what time it is, but... For now, don't know what time it is.

Cuz It's oh no.

Yeah, that's yeah, yeah, yeah. It's overnight. So 11 to seven. And then for the last week of February, it's also that same training. Still don't know what time it is.

And then wait so you said that's just you don't have shifts then No, but...

It's a virtual training, so I get to stay home. The week after. Yeah, no, still the virtual training. I get paid for it, but I get to stay home.

That's fire. I'm actually just not going to put that in my calendar then. Okay, cool. So I have your work schedule in my calendar then.

Yeah, that's my schedule. Okay. Well, what's up?

Awesome. So I will... Okay, so to... Basically like Set an agenda. I can take over the screen share. Let me pop this up. So basically, pull up this. So I've been, so this is routine. This is the notes app that I use for like everything personally. And so they just launched the feature of organizations. So you can make an organization where you can invite your team members. So right now I just have...

Me in it, and then I'm gonna get Zach in it, but basically I'm gonna get all of this, oh wait, can you even see this? Mm-mm. Oh, shit. I'm scared.

Bring out your home screen.

Yeah, oh yeah, I forgot it's monitor 3, not monitor 2. Oopsies. But basically, yeah. This is routine, but I have made a company organization for Java DGENs where I'm basically populating all of our content. And all of our content, let me also just make this full screen, all of our content is in the form of custom types. And so this just allows us to store our content a little easier. And it's also broken down into different workspaces of the company home, our marketing, our development, education, and then our operations, which is mostly just for my information surrounding the store.

But how it'll work is you'll get access to the workspaces. I'm not going to add you yet because right now people that I add can create content. And since Routine's like a, they're a super small startup. I have like a, we have a Dropout DJs channel. And they'reIn their discord That's cool Yeah, so we're going to be So. supporting them out and using They're kind of like platform for this But let me kind of just break you down into how we're looking at how I'm looking at the discord so First, I guess I'll just go through the...

I updated the mission and vision document a little bit. So this is all of our documentation that we'll be having. I only have two out of the 40 done, but they're super easy to get cracked out. Um... Just like to kind of reiterate how and get you back on the same page with my thoughts on this. Let me also just switch this to my main monitor. So I can strain my brain. but Thank you. Yeah, so basically like, oops.

To like take a step back and like actually look at the Discord and like how we've kind of progressed. actually Before I do that, I'll go to the-I'll do the company journey first. So... Thank you. to Bring it back down into-How I would look at Java with dgens, I'd say we just have three different stages. had our growth in three separate stages and the first stage was just year zero year one of building our community and that's just from breaking off in the flip-flop server to creating dropout degens and in that year we kind of scaled to from zero to 2500 members and that helped us get our first partnership and we got i think it was about five partnerships in our first year but we really just focused on one we got a lot of knowledge about So Our users coming in, like the demographic wise, because they were largely finding us through organic organically through flip.

So we learned a lot about those users that were coming in. And the next thing is like we just. we learned about our partnerships and that would actually be like a viable market for us to pursue. And so in year two, we kind of just focused on scaling our partnerships, but we didn't necessarily focus on like scaling our conversions with them. We did well with some of our social sports books like Rebet and Thrills at the time, but we kind of just didn't scale our conversions across just as our partnerships were scaling.

into like where we are now, which is we're kind of just, I'm trying to reposition the discord and we wanna just be a lot more education focused. So we wanna be, showing our members the actual value that they're getting through our partnerships. And this will not only be done by the EV that we're getting integrated, that'll help our members see that why it's profitable to have more books in their inventory or like, and also just the Um, Not only the EV, but like the Also the integrations that we have.

We have Outlier, we have OddsJam, we have Daily Run Fantasy, and I have on the list to reach out to a few more, so we'll hopefully have a few more. But we basically want to just focus on Bringing value from our partnerships and not only telling our members, hey, you have this resource, but giving them the education behind why you should use it. I guess like that's kind of a lot of our Mission Vision.

Like, the biggest thing about that is I mentioned that, like... We want to just focus on the education aspect. We want to also personalize the resources. We want to find the pain that they're experiencing, whether that be Oh, I don't– or, oh, I'm a social sportsbooks user because I use Fliff, but I don't necessarily like– um, flip for the odds they give me, and we can offer them the additional resources with the reasoning behind it.

Um, and then also, like, we're kind of, we want to try to, I guess, like, the, the kind of positioning that I would say is we're trying to, like, make all of our members into, like, analysts themselves. Um, like, we want to equip them with the resources and knowledge, like, we'll have our analyst picks, which are, what, They aren't doing good right now, but like they'll be better and but but we We want them to basically just have the resources and knowledge to fact check not only the analyst picks but their own picks if they were to look for them.

And so that's basically with how we're going to do our education first approach. So we're going to teach our members like the actual tips, strategies and give them a little bit of a look at the data. Give them resources and connect them with the tools that help them to become smarter and just come into sports betting with the mindset that it's not good gambling and it's more of the, if you manage your money right, it can be more strategic.

And so with our partnership philosophy, we're just kind of switching from the framing of like use our code for X days, which is how we've previously been doing it to like more of just add another sport, like add the sports book to your arsenal to line shop. And then you can use the bonus to experiment with whatever tools we have tailored to that partner. And that's kind of will bring a lot more value to our members.

And then they'll also get the additional bonus of like actually receiving free days. And-Basically The next thing that I'll break this down to Is into our goals Um. So, and I guess like, what do you think on that when it comes to like our positioning? Okay.

And you see how you want to make it more like an educational survey more than a... A gambling server? Because I feel like a lot of And it's like a lot of the active ones I guess they don't know about the tools we have and And I think it's good that we should promote them more. So that it helps them win more and definitely know how to manage their money if they are gambling But Um... Also with the promotional partners, I feel like...

We... I feel like at this point now, most of the people in the server that are active or that were active, they're at least 21 now. So I feel like since we don't have like... partnerships with like the major big sports books. That also might be an issue on why... They're not maybe like active in their server, you know? Because we can't give them what they're looking for, I guess.

Yeah, so I guess like to cover Or two of those points like One with the younger members like Ding. able to use the resources and one not being here we're gonna be we'll have those partnerships like literally the second I turn 21 I'm gonna have those lined up so the second thing is like I guess there's kind of two parts to this is to one we need to actually have a re-engagement campaign to like get those members engaged but I guess like there's kind of three but like second is we actually need like an active community base with the members we have and the staff we have and the processes we have so that when we launch our campaign they're not just like churned and aren't put through all of the funnels that we're trying to put them through.

And then the next thing I would say is like, the third thing is just for future plans and marketing is like, this is the not only for considering the members that we have, because we could just ignore theoretically, we can just ignore all those people that we already have. Because eventually, yes, maybe they'll come back. But we can just focus on acquiring new members rather than Thank you. I mean, of course we have our initial, but if we can't acquire them all, which we won't, we'll have to just reacquire them through marketing.

And so just like through the lens of acquiring new members and being like, this is the philosophy of how we want to teach all of our new members that are coming in as well.

Okay, and um... With the... With the... The Fluff Eevee bot and, like, the other ones, are you still... Like, do you still want to keep that, like, premium only?

So yes, the flip easy bought one it's broken right now. I need Zach to fix it. Like it's sending in basketball UV and born. The filters are not doing the best right now, and they're not happening as occasionally.

So I have a meeting with Zach this Saturday to fix our EV. And then also another thing that I want to mention upcoming is our welcome tickets.

Those are two things that should be– they were supposed to be fixed our last meeting, but whatever he pushed didn't fix it for the welcome tickets at least. But so we're going to have a I mean, there's it was in a state that was working. So we're going to make sure it's working before we hop off this weekend. So those are like. I kind of like forgot what the original thing was, but those are the two things that were we're working on for the EV and then for the EV actually being premium we'll have our flip EV that will be public for anybody who wants it and then I have to I have to redo it this might be if it's not in the projects right now it will be in but also all these EV channels I'm going to clean them up and get just completely new ones.

And the only one I'm going to keep is hockey. And I'm going to go back to like and delete all of this. This is going to take me forever. But I'm just going to delete all of it and just get to a point where we were at a good filter so I can get a little bit of reference to say this is how we did in this previous season with this data. And this is how we're taking the same strategy and approach this season with this data.

And you've got even more. And-And also I'm just gonna shit I'm gonna create new channels so there there won't be any messages So So like to kind of give you like a better answer, the only thing that will be free will be the Flippy V and then everything else will be a premium.

Okay, yeah, that was the only thing I was like, concerned about because the FLIF ED bar I feel like is the most used one, I guess. I agree.

I 100% want that to be public because one, it's kind of an intro to what we're doing. Two, we can get data from the people. Three, it's just like a like, me. like one right now our number one organic source is the flip server so uh it makes the most sense to have that um and i'm also like i'm pretty annoyed at this not sending like these should be sending in the fliv so i'm pretty annoyed at that um because that was one of the big things that i was pushing for at on like january 1st or like whatever at the beginning of january to push for um yeah but i'm also getting um i'll talk into this a little bit more in a bit but like i'm also getting access to I have a cloud code integration to our actual GitHub.

You might be able to actually I can show you this.

I don't know what that is.

But basically like for anything that I want to make any updates, like if I want to change These sending in to this channel. It's actually like harder than it seems and Like... I can very easily breaks things if I'm not I have no knowledge of our code base so like I could very easily break things because I could just think oh I need to change this in one place but it might be in multiple places but so basically like what I can do is I can now use quad to do it and just Push.

things itself. And so that's kind of like what I've been experimenting in here. But the last one I pushed didn't make it and I had to put it through and around the revisions and Zach has not got around to reviewing it but basically like kind of a long monologue of what I'm getting into is like basically I'll be able to eventually We've been so developmentally stalled has been our problem with like, because we want to personalize the features, but we need to we need to develop for that.

So, and then I guess like you might've seen this, but we have these coming.

Oh yeah, no, I saw that.

Yeah, these are things that I was like-I'm gonna put them in and like, I've been meaning to get to this channel for a while, but we're going to put in some, like, basically... All of these commands will be in here. We're going to update our resources a little bit more. they need to get pushed to the bot for that to happen. It was cool. Yeah. But that was also my fault because, let me see, I made a bunch of mistakes with whatever.

Um, Quick question though, has it ever crossed your mind to just restart?

That's basically what we're doing.

No, like, I mean, like... Well, I mean, yeah, you're restarting now, but, like, I mean, like, restart from scratch and, like, do everything right.

Um, Like, that's kind of... Yes, that's kind of like what we're trying to do. With the pivot. Like, do you suggest rebranding? Like, talk me through your thinking.

Well, no, I mean, just like... Because I know we have a lot of members now, and I feel like the only issue might be... if we restart from like the bottom up again and like try to get all those partnerships and whatever again, That's the only issue, plus the retention of the members if they do come back. Or if they don't, you know what I mean?

Okay, so I guess this is the way I'll put it is, We... We basically are restarting in the means of our community, but we have... Our partnerships which brings such a big LTV So, What we're going to do is, like, we can just ignore every single old person in our server. We just need, like, basically, we just need enough. We need 20 active members in our premium that are chatting every day, and then we'll be fine.

But, like... for that when we acquire members if basically the minimal partner acquisition on average is about 50 bucks so we can pay about like 100 bucks for 50 customers and that's two bucks per person and we only need two like if one person converts that basically makes it even. Or like two people converts and makes it even. So we really just need to... And that's conversant one partnership out of the-And that's and if they convert on one partnership, that's like 5% of the total value that they can be converted on so like We can kind of just ignore all of the old members.

I'm not really as interested in those. If we focus our marketing on the position, like... We're... Oh. we were marketing on the position of like, this is a sports betting discord. How are we differentiating? We were not as in, we were just sending picks like everybody else. So when we market, we'll have the actual, like even if we don't, and yes, even if they're not active, the 8,000 community members is a little bit of, and I'm going to prune all of them.

So it might only be like around 3,000 active that have been active in the last like three months. But we'll basically have the advantage. saying, like, this is what we've learned over the couple of years of our community, and sports bettors need the education to validate their picks more before they place them, and, like, actually the knowledge and strategies behind, like, what it takes to become profitable.

Because that's probably, I guess, like, the best way I would put it is look at the channel, or look at the messages between Reyna and Storm. in general or sweater in general yeah I saw yeah Basically, the best way I would put it is, like, Sweater is all the kind of users that we've been getting. And Reina would be all the kind of users that we're trying to have.

But wouldn't you want them in premium?

Yeah, but right now I'm not even trying to get either of them because we don't have any offering. Like... Like Poro hasn't posted in a bit and Bat Brigade hasn't posted in a bit.

I want to post, but I just don't have the time to consistently research.

Yeah, you're too busy with other things.

It's such a struggle for me because I try to get into a groove and I'll get one or two days, but if I miss one day, it's really bad because I'll just be...

Yeah, I know.

So it's like, I'm gonna try to get it back in January or like February if I have enough time, but like I'm dead ass and... And I it's like rough because if I don't have because I also just sometimes I feel I force it If I don't have the time to research if I feel like obligated to post and that's just that's worse so just Like right now I'm just not posting.

But, and also just Dante is not, well, I didn't send out today.

Yeah, I was about to ask you about Dante. Like, is he really done?

I don't know what he's doing. I kind of asked him for it by noon.

What time did he send it to me today? I remember this.

I think he sent it to you at like 11-ish.

Yeah, 1241.

Yeah, I was not sending that shit out. Like, I just got to class. Uh, uh, Oh. Like, he sent it to me right here. And this is what I have to post-play of the day. Yeah. Like... And also, I wouldn't even have been able to post it. But it's fine. And then the problem is I open the chat here, and then I'm like, oh, I can do this right now. I'm going to do this because it's really quick. And then I have to pay attention in class and do something else.

And I'm like, all right, I'll just do this later. And then I don't have the message notification. And I have so many DMs. Like, this is from 1240 today.

So, like. You're worse than me.

Yeah, so I completely just, like, I reacted to Checkmark when I saw it because I was like, I'm doing it right now. And then I was in class and I just forgot about it when I got home. So, like, he needs to get them by, like, it's not that he needs to, but, like, I just need to be better on it, though.

He's gonna get it.

Wait, why do you want him? Why do you want him to send it? Oh, is it because you have class at 12? Is that why you want him to send it before 12?

Yeah, if he sends it before 12, I just have better, like... I leave my apartment at 12:30 so like I can and also like I don't have it on my work laptop and depends on what laptop I'm using. Actually, I do have one.

You don't have Discord on both of your laptops?

No, I'm not always signed in on my, not Discord, but my Canva for Java 3.

Yeah, on my one laptop.

Um, So if I'm on the other laptop, I'm like, oh, gotta do that later. I'm just so bad at like, I read a message and then I'm like, oh, or like if it needs any sort of research, I just get distracted. But back to kind of like I'll go through like, I guess like, wait, can we go back to the, what were you saying? With the, I guess like, does that kind of make sense with how we're?

Yeah, the rebrand, yeah.

And if we focus, and we can still keep the Dropout DGEN's name and everything, because we have all those partnerships and everything. And we have some members, but we really just want to focus on like the aspect of like, we're not a pick server like anymore. Like we're not focusing on that. Like, yes, we'll have analysts that will, Even like the micro units? But I like how he does the best line. Because, like...

that's an advantageous thing of like and people like now members now have the opportunity to just go up to and be like oh so are you actually taking it on this line or where are you placing it or like and it also opens the opportunity to our partnerships and it has like the actual research behind it yeah but like I see that.

like when he did post, he was posting on an online bookie An issue with that, it's 21 plus.

Yeah, it's okay. It doesn't matter because if it's not in our partners, what we can do is just say, this is actually not one of our resources, but the closest one we have is... For example, my bookie, and then I just added back fucking bet 105.

My bookie is what, 18? Yeah.

So, and then I'm gonna add probably, Add so many more to this. It's going to be crazy. But like two kind of. To kind of show you this is actually what our partners look like in our company workspace So all of them are loaded into a database so Basically, this will be accessible to all the staff. So all of our partners are loaded up into the database. And so it shows all of their age restrictions, the code, the offer, and then the points.

I'll talk about this more in a bit. But basically, if you convert a user onto any of these and you are the person who does it, then you get three points or whatever points that comes along with it. take all the conversions all the points and you'll get and I'm gonna have a staff 5% bonus and so you'll basically just get a distribution based on how many points you made out of the total points times that 5% distribution.

Okay. But how would you know that we... We've heard them.

So there's two things. So one is going to be the free access tickets. So... when anybody creates a free and you'll be an advantageous person in this so basically if you are the reason or you are the person talking to them in the free access ticket. So for example, I'm gonna use Poro first. So if Poro says, "Hey, sign up for blah, blah, blah," and then create a free access ticket. If Poro sends that And he creates a free access ticket and sends it in this ticket.

And in this ticket, like, for example, you were the one to say, oh, here's your seven free days. You wouldn't get the claim. Poro would get the claim. But if somebody just randomly created this ticket, like a bunch of people do, or if they just created it to ask questions, like, I'm assuming a lot of people will do this. And also, what I'm going to be building into the partner promo bot is anytime they actually click on promo, it will create a ticket for them.

or like claim now or one of these but like whenever they do one of these claim now and mark is claimed they will be open the ticket for them so it will be a free-for-all for all the mods as in whoever is able to convert them onto the partner and say hey these are the steps that you need to do if you have any questions or why you should use this resource then you you will get the conversion.

So, for example, and you're like, cool, which partner?

And they just said, hey, I'm just checking it out. How many days do you get? And you say seven. I would recommend Props Madness because they're cheap and you can do the AI feature, for example, and I've been using them for all my props.

You got the partnership with them?

Not yet. I was just using them as an example because you have this knowledge.

But like, you would be able to just say your reasoning behind how you've done this and they'll be like, oh, that's really helpful. And they end up converting, then you'll get the points for that. And then the second thing will be you, let me show you this as well, is the invite links. So ignore all these HDs. The Dropout Degens bot now is creating all of our invite links. So we are now tracking our invite links through the Dropout Degens bot.

So I will get you an invite link through that bot, like just that is there that we track.

My mouse just died, so give me a second to plug it in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I will give you an invite link.

Take up one percent but uh over our super base but I'll give you an invite link that we will track and so anybody who signs up on that link Um, Okay, cool, active invites. So I will... basically all of your invites. Like for example, one of these is the DraftKings. I have a specific link listed in my bio in the DraftKings server.

I think I mentioned to you how I was gonna do this. Yeah, yeah, you did. Let me see.

And it's got like 20 joins so far. but I'm basically listed up here all the time now. I have this specific link that I'm tracking. Now we know any user that comes in off of this link is the DraftKings link. What I'll do is one, I'll give you a link for that. Then two, what we're working on doing is getting this information on the user level into the database. If this person, For example, Poro I'm going to use cams as an example for another mod.

So if cams for example were to take over the ticket and refer them and get them converted onto one of our partners, he would get the three points. But if you were the one that invited them, so if he came from your specific invite link, you would also get the same amount of points.

Very cool.

uh... and we're going to be tracking all of that uh... it'll be like more manual the first month but in the future it'll be basically anytime they do it they can mark this as claimed and when that happens they'll either have a new ticket created or or they'll get messaged in this this um in their current ticket and then the way that mods will give all access um will be just um you can give them a button to claim um right now currently you have the command to create this.

You can just do true and seven and that gives them the free days for that. But in the future, what I'll do is anytime they click the bot, you'll get the mods will get something in the ticket that also pops up that says, Is this verified? And if they like said, send a screenshot of them using our code or like it verified in some way, then all you have to do is mark it in there and then it'll add the seven days.

Okay.

But that's going to be a lot of building. And I'm not even going to give you a timeline on that because I can't even give you a timeline for the Flippy V.

But that is how I envision that working. So it'll be... really both the people who convert and then for example if you're both the one that is Handling them in the ticket and you're the one that invited them boom.

That's a double whammy for you Six points!

And it can be up to, like, ten for chalkboard, want to parlay, not chalkboard, fuck chalkboard, parlay play, want to parlay, sleeper. But yeah, so this is our partners. And then also, like, in this is if you were to come in here, and I have to... And yeah And this is where it'd have to give you edit for permissions to view. But like you can just copy and say, if somebody has a question or like, in any of the channels and says, oh, which app is that?

You just do. It's this. Oh.

And you, like, this is just easy copy, um, and then paste.

Um, and if you need any of the media for any reason, I, I have it all listed in here. And so this will be just like for all the staff to have. And so that's kind of how Our partners are going to go into it. Let me show you our goals. So I broke it down into Um 16 different goals technically should be 15. I'm gonna get rid of one of these But I have 15 just high-level goals and these goals aren't like They aren't like tangible, like they're not 5,000 members, but they're things that we're just working towards and like...

So they're not necessarily like Acquireable physically, but they're things that we our goal to work towards so I guess I have them kind of ordered by quarter and order by quarter is kind of as in Um... Order by quarters just kind of like as in when we're gonna evaluate the goal So we'll evaluate I'll evaluate all of these goals at the end of quarter one And then we'll evaluate all these goals at the end of quarter two But these goals are gonna be worked on from now until then So I guess like I kind of was...

How long have we been in this? Let's see. Let's say 11:45, 45 minutes. OK.

Give me one second.

Yeah, no problem.

So let me time block this.

Okay, so I don't want to spend too long on this and then I also don't want to keep us in this too long. So, Uh... I originally wanted to talk through each of these goals. Um... Actually, I'm just going to talk through all these goals and if we get there if it starts taking me a while and Then we can just cut it short But basically after I talk through all of these goals I'm gonna talk a little bit about just the overall goal that we're working towards and then everything that we're going to Well, I'm gonna talk about the goal that we're working towards and then kind of like the why behind it and how it fits into our overall like scope and mission and then I'm going to talk about just a quick overview of the projects for the goals and then just to kind of like finish up the agenda I'm going to want to set a couple of KPIs on this call just because we haven't been really keeping up with them, the ones that we set, and really want to...

If we want to, like... Um, We really just need to make sure that we stay on top of these things because it keeps getting harder the longer we keep pushing it off.

And I've been pushing it off a while because I haven't had everything in place to get all the staff ready.

And it's kind of been a hard thing to juggle. But I think we're kind of in this place where I probably jumped the gun going like a little bit a month early, but I'd rather be earlier than sorry, but Kind of like now in a place where we kind of have to get our community active for the features that we are building to actually be effective. Um. So just the last thing that I want to do is set a couple like KPIs.

So this will be like the daily poll by X date or by like X time. And then I'll adjust. My so on my calendar I've been doing like a good job of keeping myself to my calendar But I'm gonna be doing a lot better job of it but I have like the post daily poll. I'll adjust this weekly like based on what your schedule is. Like since you work 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. I won't ask you to post the poll before you go to work.

But if you try to post your poll the poll like by like four or five by by like four or five. Yeah, that would be good. Yeah, especially because it's weekdays.

So...

The only issue, I mean, I have no problem with posting the poll that late, but I just feel like there's not going to be enough time to vote, especially... On weekends too, because on weekends too there's a lot of early games.

Yeah, I know, I know, yeah, I guess... I'll have to figure out. Because I kind of... Do you... I can take the poll off, but we'll need to... Because that was...

Because when I do my seven to threes... I'd either go on break at 10, 11, or 12. So, I mean... I could do it during then. I can either do it 10 or, yeah, depends on whenever I'm going on break. 12 is the latest I'll go. because that's their rules, I guess. But yeah, it's either 10, 11, or 12. I go on break, and... I have an hour break, so I definitely will have time to post. the poll but recently I haven't been able to because since I'm Training still, I guess.

Um... I've been just like focusing on that because it's a lot. My job is a lot and there's a lot of things I gotta memorize and shit. So that's why... Hole has been slacking.

Lately No, no, and you're, yeah, and you're good. And also, if it was really... that big of, and I guess like the biggest way I would put it is, oh, sorry, I hope you can still hear me. I'm going to my kitchen. But the biggest way I would put it is the poll is not something that will necessarily drive direct revenue.

Like it won't be in a conversion every day.

But what it will allow for is one, the community engagement. And then two, if we get Yeah.

At that point, it's about the conversion.

Yeah.

So like we just need to start getting into that schedule now and it's also on me to make sure that we're staying on top of it and then to jump in. But I guess like the biggest thing I'll say for and then we'll jump back to this like the poll as a KPI but like the biggest thing about this would be if it's something that is manageable and that you are willing to do but you're just forgetful because it's not in your schedule which is completely fine because it's a poll.

up in like in your consistent schedule because it's not been something that i've consistently pushed for um but if you need like reminders like i will get better at giving you reminders to get the poll um and we can um do it from there and then i'll also like jump in and make sure that i'm actually jumping in um at the time um just um it'll be it's just a little easier now that i have um the time references um for like when i would need to jump in um and then actually keeping it And then it's also like the double whammy of both you and Dante, keeping you guys both on it.

And if one of you guys isn't on it, then...

Yeah.

Keep both of you guys on it.

pressure the other one to be on it. So, like, it's really gotta be a team effort, and... Just everybody's gotta be on it. So I'm gonna try to keep it pretty small and what I'm gonna be doing as the KPIs and like the goal like not the goals but the The tasks I'm gonna call them like the poll will be a task And then I'll just talk to you like with what you actually think for example that the Evie bot could be a task but What we just talk when we get there about kind of that but what I'll do now is I'll talk through the Just the project.

Does that sound good by the way?

Yeah, but another thing... Sorry. But another thing with the poll, like... Sometimes I have an issue with... I was like, what? you like what to put in the poll especially now since NFL is about to end College football is over. No one really watches college basketball. Hockey, same thing. Normally watches it. And then with NBA, a lot of times it's just... The games are just... Boring. You know what I mean?

So I set a weekly poll schedule or a weekly game schedule for Layup. What I'll do is I'll just send you... Oh, yeah.

Okay.

That's fine.

But, like, the poll, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter at all. Like, only thing that I will ask is you have to do the Super Bowl.

You have to do the Super Bowl.

Yeah, no, no. Yeah, the Super Bowl was the main thing. I'm not going to forget because I know it's this Sunday. So, I'm not going to.

You better do it at, like, mid. No, just kidding. You better do it, like, 8 a.m. the second you wake up.

No, yeah, because I'm off the weekends until I start, like, actually doing overnight. I'm off the weekends. I know Super Bowl is going to be one of the main things. Plus, I'm going to go watch the game at a bar. So I know I won't forget.

Awesome. Okay, cool.

So yeah, that'll be, yeah, that's definitely like the biggest game. Do not forget that day. But like any other day, like, it's fine. But we'll be just trying to just, I guess like the biggest push. We're kind of just going in multiple stages of pushes. And the best way I would just put it that way is it's kind of just like, you staff motivation. Like I'm pushing as hard as I can with as many people as I have onboarded, but it's kind of like if the team, like for example, if my analysts aren't sending plays, and it's also on me for not having the time to send plays, but if my analysts aren't sending plays, then it's kind of like the...

it's not worth it to push for that so I've been focusing more on the like just actually getting all this together, kind of push rather than the engagement. So we just need to actually get all together and get that momentum going, and then we'll be in a good spot. Okay. So for all these goals, so they're basically broken down into Just a couple parts of one, when it's going to be evaluated. Two, how important this goal is to us.

And then three, what responsibilities the goal ultimately fault? Excuse me falls down too so I guess I'll start with the four founder goals first, and then I'll talk through each individual one. But the four main ones are we need to differentiate our discord positioning, which is eventually, which is I can't speak, essentially just finish our pivot, just finish getting all the information out, finish the commands, get the buckmans out, get all of our strategies updated, and actually just the resources.

More channel updates and just basically just getting all the information and onboarding figured out so when people join the server and find the server they know that they're not only coming in for picks they're coming in for the education. And so the next thing out of that is we want to, we need to raise our pricing to actually validate that like we have The... like... I guess like the best way I would say is like Our offer is a lot more validated at $50 rather than $15 a month.

So we're just going to raise our pricing to $50 a month and then that'll also help us convert better on our partnerships because members get better value as in they won't have to pay $50 for the and we're actually going to only give seven free days. Let me show you. It's a little side tangent to our other offer. to our marketing dash or to our marketing home where we have our offers. But basically if anybody uses our Dropbox code on any of our partners, they receive seven days of free access.

And then if they use our code on any three of our partners, they'll receive 30 free days. So basically, That's instead of 33 days for one that's we're going to be doing 73 days for one. So that'll help us with just when we differentiate our positioning like actually the conversions onto the partnerships because one, we're just not even focusing on the, oh yeah, you get the all access, that's not going to be the driver.

The driver is going to be the education with the secondary of the all access. so With differentiating our positioning and raising our prices, we also just have to expand the resources that we have. And so this is, there's a couple of parts to it. So there's one, there's, I want to get the apps like Kaoshi, Fuck, what's the other one? Um... I think it starts with a P or whatever, but... whatever the markets are i want to get those um and our partnerships um and then we also just i want to get more tools so props madness is one and there's a couple other websites and then apps that people have recommended to me um so i'm going to get those see if they have partnership codes and discord integrations and then get them into our partnership list and then the third thing is just like the sports books when i turn um 21 so we've got kind of three waves of partnership acquisitions that are coming And so then the fourth thing is like, What we're going to help do to boost our community engagement because we're kind of just dead and rather than having to wait and focus on our re-engagement campaign, we can just fucking pay and buy another community.

And so the way that I'm going to be paying is mostly through just equity and not even equity, but just like the revenue share through dropout degens. That will be how we'll... We need to have some members currently active for that, but basically by acquiring another community, and I have a few that I'm currently looking at, but... We can just one, hire a new analyst, two, hire new mods, and then three, test our actually education first approach approach and see how well our conversions go with these members who are one used to paying for picks who are now paying for just education So that'll be like a really just a quick start for that.

Um. And then I guess like timeline wise, um, I guess projects, this is the only one that I'll really go into deep for projects. So for differentiating our positioning, so we need to, we just need to, we need to update more of our content. This is not fully completed, but we've also mostly cleaned up the previous states. I have to see how many more channels we're gonna remove, but we're basically in a pretty good, like, Just...

We're not in a pretty good spot. We need to come up with more things to finish off and then we'll be in a really good spot for this is the education first approach we're taking with the Discord. And then I just need to get the documentation first and then I'll have that information updated. But basically, we've released the initial EV for Fliff filter. It's not fully released how we wanted it to, but it is released as we have a filter.

We need to update our responsible game I have a whole like blurb in my notebook that's written out, I actually don't even know what it is. But like we want to just Not only... We want to have the education of... the aspect of Yes, at the end of the day, no matter how you approach this, it is gambling. So even if you have the smartest strategy, it is gambling. And there are just like things that you can do.

Here's what I have. So like just in essence that like sports betting is a form of gambling and carries inherent risks. to drop your degenerate gambling strategies and just become a more profitable bettor. We can possibly do something around that. And so we just want to also just help our members have the mindsets of view their bets as measures of units to focus on that profitability of margins of just how many units you're making rather than money to kind of help.

escape the gambling aspect of it and really encourage the smarter bankroll management and then we'll just like have a couple of our resources as in like here's how you can use our partners responsibly if you need to take a break here's how you can use flip and you can collect the daily dollar or if you just need a break from betting entirely like you can make sports about the game again and you can use layup and actually instead of wagering money every time like you're you You can actually just save money instead.

And just that's kind of like the responsible gaming approach. And I'm just going to have like a ticket for if you want to talk more. But the next thing we're going to have is just this really goes into when we are. positioning and marketing the server. We need to, one, we're fixing our welcome tickets. So everybody who joins the server will get a ticket and the server welcome created. But the second thing we need to do is actually just, I'm creating a messaging procedure for the welcome tickets, but we want to just basically talk to our members, understand like what can we actually educate you on?

Like what do you need? What are the best resources that we can set you up with? Like we want to understand more about like why, Our members are actually here and what we can do to best bring the value and then we just need to just actually Once we've done all this in the discord We need to one update our onboarding Some members understand that this is what they're coming in for and then we're going to just market more on the discords side with the discord server webpage and so Then I guess like the next thing in Q1 is just improving our server retention is huge goal we want to make sure that we're actually active and This is I guess like the best way I put it is from the period of February 1st because this is when I have most of my calls and I'm not gonna be doing payments this month.

I don't think because we didn't even ever knew like $500 but And also just a lot of general and activity but I'm going to get everybody onboarded so they understand that payments will be starting in February and really gonna use February 1st until the Super Bowl as a huge push for like getting our retention numbers and actually up. And so the last thing about this is just the staff culture adoption.

This is basically just we want the staff to have the same mindset that that I'm kind of talking about now, which is that they want to actually focus on bringing their members value. And this is actually just like, it's super easy. Like instead of trying to really have that sales approach, we want to just more of have the education approach. We want our members to ask a question about an app, for example, that we're using or a tool that we send a screenshot of.

And we want to actually educate our members on why and say, "Oh yeah, I like Props Madness because Of X Y & Z So like that's really just the education aspect that we're focusing on and the caveat of that is they'll use we don't want to push our code because we know they'll use our code to one support the server because our subscription cost is high and they'll get the free access but two just because of the actually human interaction of it of these are the people who are helping me find

So I'm going to support them. And so then the last two things are just like we're going to create the staff KPIs, get all of our staff under contractors because I'm going to use this as not only like a way to, I wouldn't say even keep myself accountable, but to just help our staff. more get the impression. that they're going to get paid. 'Cause we kind of have been slacking on the payments and we've also just been completely slacking on revenue.

But The last thing out of that is just the staff weekly meeting schedule. If people are going to get compensated, I want to be able to just have a weekly meeting. So I'm going to be bringing in, and I know I wasn't able to stand on top of those as much previously, but I will be doing a lot better of a job. It's been hard because we've just not been doing as well, but I think we have the approach and the positioning to do well.

And we've kind of been like I've been sitting on this we've been sitting on this opportunity that's been building for about a year now so it's about time that we start to take advantage of it. And so the last thing out of that is just like we're going to be optimizing our conversion funnel. So that's just a development thing as in we're going to be building out the features for example what I talked about with the partner promo bot and we're also going to be building out the free this tickets to be more automatic and all the just everything Everything that makes our conversions better and really don't have too much now because we don't have a conversion funnel, but we just want to be constantly making it better and just optimizing how we can get better conversions.

That was kind of a long monologue. Do you have anything you want to like kind of...

Stop and talk about for here for these q1 goals For the partnerships like Props Madness that I mentioned to you about, Um I think it's $20 a month. I don't know if there is a price or not. But with that new thing I sent to you yesterday... Yeah, yesterday. With their... That thing is free. It's free. So I don't... I don't the only issue the thing it's free but it's limited I don't know if you like actually looked at it yeah yeah I did It only shows points and assists.

It doesn't show like... Um And it only does NBA, I think.

And it doesn't do everybody.

Yeah, it only shows points and assists. So I get why it's free. But For Props Madness 2, um... Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me... Let me, let me, let me... One second. One second, one second, one second. Um, The only issue with Prop Madness is that they don't have an app right now. I don't know when they're going to release an app.

Yeah, but that's fine. It's not necessarily a big issue.

And then the thing is, but also with Prop Madness, it's very hard to read. Especially, but if we're promoting it with some of the people on our server, I guess for them it'll be easier because they already know they're betting already. But Let's say we get a new... We get a new sports editor. And we want to promote That as one of our main goals. Tools, I guess. It would be hard to read.

So yeah, so that's kind of to... go into the partnerships database is this is where it'll just be like best judgment. So one in, Welcome Ticket bank robot and it'll personalize all the unit size things that in the server to you and then for example to follow up like they don't then we can just tell them to create a unit size we suggest and it'll be with all of our strategies and analysts use unit sizes and it's a really just stronger and more responsible way to manage your bankroll.

And then we can kind of just follow up with like, Do you track your bets? You don't? You can use here our spreadsheet. We have a spreadsheet if you kind of like that. That's one of our resources. Or you can use our partner Picket. And we're kind of just going to like tailor each to the things to like, what do they need? And we're going to try to just have it more conversationally based. So it'll be more of like, maybe props cache might not be the best resource for them.

But when it comes to the betting tools, they'll be like... other ones as well so maybe you think And Props Madness might be like a one value partnership, like Props Cash, but for example, Props Madness might be too complicated for them, so you might want to say, oh, you should use Props Cache. That is a really good one. And if you don't want to pay for it, you can use the integration that we have in our server.

Yeah, but like, hold on, let me just share my screen real quick. Thank you. Hello?

Hello?

Hello? Hello? Can you see my screen? No. Oh, do you see it now?

Uh... No.

Did I just break my... Hold on. You know?

Oh, I see loading now instead of a gray screen. Yes, I see, I see.

Like, you see what I mean? Like the new sports better would not know what any of like here would not know what like any of this means Yeah Like I like when I when I first started using this like this tool like I didn't know anything either But the good thing about them, I guess is like they have a whole like YouTube on how to use their tool So yeah, so I guess like kind of what you're saying is...

Maybe props cache or maybe props madness might not be the best tool for them, but you but like if you're the moderator talking to them in or like in that welcome ticket, like you'll start to have an understanding of like what kind of better. And also I'm going to work on onboarding on actually flagging the users for like right now we have a question of like. like your bedding, whatever. But we're gonna actually make it a role so when the moderators come in you kind of see like what kind of better they are so if they've used If they're a straight better, parlay better, if they are a DFS or sportsbook user, if they are...

Let me see what else I have. But like kind of if they are a new better or familiar. So like for the and so like kind of what I'm getting at is like. You have the knowledge to and also like for this, how you're showing is yes, I agree. It is a lot complicated, but we also want to just take the aspect of. not all resources might be best for them. So we can give them first props cache and say, one, you start with the props cash bot channel and if you like that you can try out their subscription and if you like that then there's actually a better tool than props cash that is the same price Okay.

By the way, I'm taking this line.

What is it? Wait, I can't see. 12, 11, 12. Over 29 and a half.

That's so high, though. I'm not going to lie, but I'm still taking it. Bye.

But, like, does that make sense for kind of, like, the framing for that?

Yeah, yeah, I get what you mean. But the only issue is props cash is, what, $30 a month now? Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

It's for them. Like, the whole point is...

Yeah, yeah, for the trial and stuff.

For the resources, it's not as much.

We want them to... Yes, we want them to pay, but we also want to have them more integrated. Like, I think props cash, and no offense to props madness, but for most bettors, like, A lot of this is too much. They just want to see the last five. So, like... just direct it to our channel is good enough until they have enough experience that they say that they want to explore on their own or they can get prompted by us but like the point is that They'll have the initial...

just one, they'll have the initial familiarity with the kind of tools from our initial Discord integration. And then they'll also just have When they actually go to say oh, I want to actually check this out if they want to discount they will use our code And so it'll be kind of like it goes into the four members that use your link. This will be the really huge driver that they'll be acquired onto things without you necessarily having to promote them.

Okay. So that, yeah, that's kind of like why we want to focus on the, that's the education, that's how the education aspect applies to like, how we can approach the promotion. Because it doesn't even feel like promotion at that point. It feels like just... These are the resources and these are this is what job out DJs has integrated to help us get accustomed with these resources And yes, they do cost money But one there's a code and two I can use this free resource until because I'm already paying for job out DJs So I can use this free resource inside drop out DJs from this partner and when I either I don't want to pay for job out DJs anymore Okay, I can pay 20 bucks a month for this partner for this month and get I Like...

7 free days at dropout degens and try this and if I don't like it then I'm gonna come back to the community and I guess like kind of like with this expired sub channel what we're gonna start doing is like hey what did we not do that fulfilled you oh I just was too expensive oh okay that's I understand that makes sense did you find value in the tools okay which tools oh you found value in the props cache bot oh that's great if you sign up for our props cache partnership it's actually only 20 bucks and we'll 7 free days if you want to check it out more and that's kind of like how we're going to be able to approach these things Okay, sounds good.

And then I guess like anything else for like those kind of Q1 goals?

Um, no. Not really.

And then do you have any like concerns with that?

With what? Like the goals in general?

Either the goals or the framing that we're pushing towards.

What do you think the time frame is for the... the Q angles? Like, what do you... How long do you expect to actually complete them all or try to...

Yeah, so I guess like one is they're gonna be evaluated at basically March. Honestly, I don't even know how quarters work if it's March 31st or April 1st. At the end of the quarter is when we'll evaluate it formally. But I'm also going to be making a dashboard for each of these, and I'm going to be setting a North Star KPI for each of these. So they're going to be very ongoing things. So, for example, the Optimized Conversion Funnel, that's kind of like one of the goals that'll be more ongoing.

But they expand Discord resources. I would say, and then this kind of goes into the projects, and these will be segmented into waves. And so reach out to tools. Okay, so I don't have the tools in my projects, but technically sportsbooks and then the extra markets are also projects. And so I would say markets are in wave one, which is current from now until like the Super Bowl is like kind of like wave one.

2 is kind of like from the Super Bowl until like just the next month. That's like we're really until the end of February. That's kind of like we're really trying to focus on getting everything into a stable point so that we can actually start to market and position and that's kind of goes into wave 3. So The best way I would say is that Like for these goals, we're going to look at them and say, On March 4th, we'll look at the dashboard and say, oh, this is the amount of partners in our database.

And it went up one this week, two this week, five this week. And so, yes, we did a good job at expanding our Discord resources. But for the goals... That's it. That's the best way I would... put them. And so I guess like four concrete dates. With wave one, and all of these goals kind of like expand across multiple waves. And so with wave one, and that's of the differentiate discord positioning, like that's, to be done by the Super Bowl is really just like actually having all of our information updated to be education first.

And actually, like, I wouldn't say that our Discord reflects everything that we've talked on today that we're trying to push towards today. And then once it kind of does, that's when I would say, Wave one is done. And then like, since I have like this meeting recording, it makes it so much easier for me to kind of like actually go through and make these updates. Because I have my. it's easier to like go through them and actually after I've had this conversation to say this is what I'm actually going to be doing and get income kind of feedback on it but I That was probably a bad answer to your question of like, concrete dates.

No, that's fine. Like I know... you're just starting, so you really don't have a set time timeframe on when Quarter one goal should... Some might be done.

Yeah, so I guess like another part would be like, I'm still kind of trying to get all the different all the staff on board as well.

So you're the first person here I can my calendar.

So Nice. section I get back Because it was way too cold and I didn't remember to. It was like the play of the day. Oh no. But yeah, I still have to talk to Dante. And then I have to talk to basically all the analysts and mods again. But we're basically... It's very reliant on... how effective the staff can be because it is it's such a team effort that we need all parts working and I guess like it technically couldn't could be a non-team effort and this is like something I was considering like theoretically like we don't need analysts we just need me and so if this doesn't go well we have the fallback of when I'm over the summer I can literally just bear down and be be our only analyst and kind of I don't want to do that, but, like, just be the, just be, like, I'm the, if you want education and knowledge, but I actually just need to be able to get my research in a place where I'm consistently profitable and consistently able to research, and that would be over the summer, but I guess, like, the best thing I would say is, like, we need all the staff to be on board.

And so I'm talking to maybe getting two more guys.

Kaden, I don't know if you're familiar with him.

Yeah, I remember Kaden.

Yeah, he's, I love him.

He's been a while for a long time. Like, and then Nanu, I'm gonna talk to him sometime. I actually have to, he's more of a scheduling. Let me just put all these three together. But, like, these are the three meetings I have to schedule for this week. And then I have a meeting with Zach. On Saturday at 10:00 a.m. I think... Let me see.

um Are you trying to get? Anyone like on staff?

Maybe.

He said he would be maybe interested in helping us out. So I'm just going to try to... I'm just going to kind of like have the same conversation with him. Not the same, but I'm going to pitch him basically on like what we're trying to do and see if he wants to kind of help out and then see what he would be interested in helping out with. And so that's kind of... And then not scheduled is I have to get Kronos, Poro, and Luke on the phone for analyst-wise.

And then-But yeah, so I would say...

Yeah, okay, yeah.

Yeah, so I have to get a bunch of people like actually on schedule So the biggest thing I would say and then we need to set and then I know this has gone gone a little long So the last thing that I'll do is I just want to set some like goals and KPIs oh And the next thing the last thing I want to talk one more thing before that is just a document that I'm creating so for the staff for the payments to do is I'm going to so I'm going to Um.

Adjust the staff payments. Or like the percentages and also how the payments are done. So I'm going to take 20% off that goes directly to the bonus funds from our subscription and monthly revenue. And so that'll be the bonus funds being paid on a monthly basis. And it's a little bit different because it'll come just straight off the top. And then I'll take that 80% that is left over and then 100% of that will be distributed to the on a monthly basis.

And so it basically works out the same that you get whatever percent out of just 80. So it works out the exact same number-wise. So, but the only thing that I'm considering doing is essentially I'm going to put in a requirement and I want to hear your thoughts on this that For the staff, both analysts and moderators will be eligible for the staff bonus and then they'll both get a percentage for with the monthly revenue, just kind of like how it was been doing.

The only thing is the addition to the bonus, and it's not like the number one performer, it's just the bonus pool. And so the only thing that I'm considering is doing is adding a requirement of to receive your, for example, 4% of monthly revenue and subscription, you must complete at least five conversions to receive that just allotment and if you don't risk if you don't for example you're only able to get two conversions then you would only receive the staff bonus and not your just Just.

your 4% or 5% or does that make sense?

Yeah, it does. So, I mean, it gives... I guess, um... Like the staff. I guess more of an incentive to get conversions so that we get that extra 2%.

Yeah, so, also, um, I have to look, like, I don't even know, I'm, I'm looking at, I'm redoing, like, all of my numbers, um, but... Basically, I'm thinking I'm going to have around 10. 10% allotment for the head staff. And I think Zach is going to be and he's going to be actually a very low equity contributor. But I think I'm going to be having you and Dante and very up in the air on Dante depending on because I can just do the daily polls, not the daily, the daily for picks, and he doesn't send picks anymore, and he doesn't talk on the server, so I'll have to see with him.

These numbers are contingent on him, but I'm considering, so I have my 10% allotment for the head staff, and I'm going to break that up into 4% for both you and Dante, and then 2% for Zed. And then I might have a future additional development fund, but this will basically be what I'm thinking for the head staff. So what do you think on that?

Yeah, that's fine. Okay, cool.

And that is open to change. Um. Subject Dante. Yeah, I just have to figure out, I have to get on a call with him first. But basically that's, and I'll give you more formalized documents on this, but like, and I also, we just haven't been making any money recently. Literally, like, I've been getting $40, like, every other week from our subscriptions. So we've, like, actually been, and we have no partnership revenue.

But actually we do, but I haven't claimed it yet. is in February since I have a 500 or it might be like $600 bonus from one of our partners that I'll be claiming starting February. So it'll go in the February period. So. And it's basically from all the work that we've done for one of these partners, but not claimed yet. So I'm going to claim that in the February period. So it's going to be a little add-on bonus as well.

Okay, cool.

Yeah, so it all...

Because that's basically... Like, more revenue that is unclaimed that we've made in the past two months combined, probably. So, like... Um... So we'll be and it's also been like It's been hard because it's It's very hard to get the staff motivated. without payment and also just very hard to get enough payment like dollar wise for the staff to be motivated. So hopefully this little both switch with the bonus and then the education first will help us get one our conversions up so we can just start bringing more revenue in and then also just help get the server more active so we can do well our subscriptions which will have their cost raised as well Hmm.

Yeah. Okay, so the last thing, sorry that we're just getting to this, but is to just set like a couple of tasks. So, So for these tasks I have Just like a couple in mind for the Um... But I guess like... I wanted to let You I want to open the floor to you first to see what you think you can be doing and we can put like a kind of like tangible thing that we'll be like looking at when it comes to either engagement in the server or just like overall conversions.

Um...

I could definitely once I have like a fixed schedule because right now with work it's all over the place since I'm still training because training Well... What they said was my training was six weeks, but they're cutting it short because I'm learning everything too fast, they said. So... Yeah. My training I guess efficiently ends in two weeks. Two weeks. Two... Two weeks? Yeah, two weeks. That's when it officially ends.

Yeah, because I'm learning too fast. Um... But yeah, once I have a set schedule of 11 to 7... I could definitely... Um... be more active in the server. Because... Since I'm also doing overnight, It's going to be half the time it's going to be dead anyways. So I'm going to be on my phone. But the only issue is I know... During those hours, no one's really going to be up except for maybe one or two people.

But before work, I could... Um... Definitely be on the server, like, talking and, uh... chatting up about like what I have for the day or what other people have for the day. And then for like conversions about our partners. So I haven't used Props Cache. And Like a couple months. But... I can try to get people to use props cache first since it is easier. Because like what I showed you, Pops Madness is definitely a little more harder to read.

For some people.

And yeah.

Okay, yeah, there's some good. So first, I'll do props cache. So rather than trying to get people to use props cache or like props madness, because that might be a little harder to track. Why don't we just like set your goal to be either sending, sharing, Yeah, let's just say sharing a props tool And so that can either be in this form of a screenshot of props madness or a screenshot of, well you don't use props cache, it doesn't matter.

So either like a screenshot of props madness prop or using the props cache bot. I think those would be a lot easier to just track as a KPI and then also just be a lot easier for you to actually find success on.

Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, I could definitely... Um... Post a screenshot on what I'd like. on Props Madness. Or even sometimes like on the... On, like, the Props Madness Instagram, they post or, um... They posted their... play of the day, I guess, or their pick of the day. And maybe I could just steal it from them.

Yeah, that is good. Yeah.

That all sounds like... I guess like the ultimate... Drive would be either You using the props cache bot and somebody followed up and uses it as well or you sending a picture of one of our partners and thumb actually engaging and saying, oh, what is that? Like not even like that they, use it, but just actually saying why you like props madness rather than props cash.

Um, yeah.

So like, like, I guess like the, the biggest part is it doesn't need to be, and then I'll actually, I'll sign this to you. Um, when you get added to this. Um, but, um, And this will be... priests I'm just going to say this is going to be increasing community engagement. increase in community engagement Because we want engagement around the tool, not necessarily the tool usage. Let me see. I lost my mouse.

Oh, no, it just died. That's why.

Seriously, I was like where did my mouse go? Why is nothing like clicking? Makes sense. But I guess like... And then overall engagement, I think we'll come back to that because that can be broken up into like a little bit easier of goals. But I guess like Yeah, we'll come back to that. So the ones that I was thinking, and so one obviously is just the post daily poll. I'll assign that as a task to you.

And so uh... first Dilly. Pull for you required Daily. Uh, owned by you. And this is to increase community engagement.

Mm-hmm.

And then the next thing I would say this is just like an overall more for like the mod and this probably didn't really come to mind because we don't have any engagement right now. But this might be. A little bit harder for you to manage because they're threads not like ticket channels so I'd like a little more feedback from you to see like what's working and what's not with this ticket system because it is very new and they just But I think one of the tasks that I want to assign to you is to check the or manage the support to manage open support or yeah manage open support tickets So like these have all been broken into very and these are all actually updated except for a few of them I think it's just premium walkthrough and then the server welcome and the responsible gaming need to be an expired sub need to be updated But for example like the general support Like I've given like basically these are what you can use all these channels for But people if they have general support, they'll probably Create a ticket here and it just might be Pretty just general.

I honestly don't know what people will ask in these but I have that the free access will be people like needing the codes. So this will be actually your chance as also as a KPI, but your chance to get more conversions and people signing up. And then for the subscription help, this will be more of this. And I'll help to manage these as well because they'll need mine. But like for these, if somebody says anything, just actually tagging me in these is great.

And just saying, hey, we're on it. Ask for you or look into it and then partnership inquiry if anybody reaches out this is where they will be staff same as them and then bug reports like just tag bell cube if somebody creates ticket here, but basically just if somebody creates ticket The way you're also, let me make a simple one for you. So it'll show up like this. You won't necessarily see this ticket to 90 button, but nobody can type in these channels.

So if it looks like this, like there's been sent another message, that means that somebody created ticket in a thread. Okay.

And honestly, the...

The big one would be the server welcome, but that's not even open yet. And I also, I'm going to be trying to do as much as it might be hard for me, but I'm going to do as much of the server welcome as possible. Cause I'm going to just be trying to tailor the messaging before I say, Hey, go and do this. But yeah, basically for most of these tickets just there won't be actually much action for you to look at but if there is it would be really good for you to just look into them and then What I'll do is if I start seeing tickets that you don't respond to, what I'll do is I'll just make sure that either if they're not seeing you, maybe we need to add a tag for them, for example.

And I'm going to change these. Tags to be mods for all these channels by the way and the head staff and owner will only get like the the premium walkthrough and the server welcome, but the mods will get everything else. But basically, if you need a tag or anything, we can manage that. But I'll put this as a task for you so we can start to see. If it's kind of like working as a system. And this is to overall improve our server retention, make sure people are sticking around.

And I guess the biggest thing would be having a good support. And this is, of course, when you are available and the other mods will be available. The mod KPI will be to answer created support tickets, but you're just going to be the managing as in if nobody's responded, please respond. But the mods will also have a responsibility of managing the open tickets.

Okay, that's good. Yeah, because I would definitely need help sometimes.

Yeah, I don't even know how the free access even works yet.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, like, this all needs to be, like, updated. Like, nobody's even said anything in any of these messages for me, so, like, it's not helpful at all. So, like, there's not really as much for you to do for the support messages, but I'm going to leave it as a task for, just, like, if you see anything, this way, for leaving it as a task, now I know that if you see it and you say something, that I know it's working.

And then the next thing, wait, post play day. And then yeah, and I guess like the last thing for community engagement I guess I guess I would just say try to Create discussion in five unique channels. Mm-hmm. Um... And like the best way I would put it is like, yeah. Um... It's not required, but it is very high impact thing for you to do. And this will be every daily thing assigned to you. And this will be increased community engagement.

So I guess these will be the four tasks. Um. I need to do a better way of assigning these to you. So when you actually get access to seeing all this, you'll see what's assigned to you. Um. But right now, I don't remember if I said, but right now, It's a little finicky because you can create things, so I don't want to... Um, and they're also, some of their stuff acts, like, gets easily corrupted, so I don't wanna have anything just accidentally get broken until they just give the view only permission, so, but once that comes out, I think it'll be like this week they said, um, you'll get access to, um, all of our information.

Okay, nice.

But yeah, so I'll just leave. So these four will be, let me just hide. me at this much messengers And these are your tasks. So the two that are the most important that I will be very actively checking in daily. until from now until like these are going to be the most focused will be from now until the Super Bowl will be the post daily poll and the managed open support tickets. So really just post the daily poll.

That's the number one thing and really is depending on how much time you have given your work schedule and kind of just start to figure out how active you're able to be in the discord with some things.

Okay, yeah, I'll definitely get those things done for you, or at least... Try to...

awesome yeah and do you have any any Any questions for anything so far?

No, I do not.

Yeah, that's all I kind of wanted to... There's a lot more in our... Like... Overall, just database, all right, what we have in here. But you'll get access to all of this when sometime hopefully this week The only thing you won't get access to is the operations database probably. Because this is where I'm going to leave all of my... Just like the companies that I'm gonna be reaching out to. I'm gonna have all the, The staff guys in here.

Um... So probably not going to add you to the operations, but you'll have all of the company home and all of our context. So it'll be just available for you to view on your own and actually kind of have an easier way to understand.

Okay, but you can do it whenever you have the chance.

I will, I will.

Yeah, and it's blocked until... until it actually gets released, so... But yeah, does that kind of sound good for everything Yeah, and do you have any concerns for direction? Because it's definitely a lot in where we want to be from where we are right now. If there's any concerns, I'd like to hear them to see what we can address.

No, there's no concerns as of right now. Everything does sound pretty good. Unlike the goals and... But... Yeah. On what I have to do too.

Okay, cool. I think I've tried to keep everything pretty feasible and then also pretty like acknowledgement of our current state. And like, I guess like the best way I would put it, be we have such a Good bill Like, we just have such a good opportunity, but we didn't have everything built to capitalize on it. And we're just really trying to figure out how to capitalize on it now. that we've figured out what our opportunity is.

Okay. But yeah, yeah. Anything else?

No, sir.

Okay, let me send you the screenshot for this. But yeah, we will Also for next week, let me just do one last thing. Let's set-Um, Time for a call next week. Monday or Tuesday would probably work best for me.

Um.

Yeah, well... After three though. Yeah. Yeah, anytime after 3:00.

We can either do like four on Tuesday or we could do on Monday at like 9:00 Let's do foreign Tuesday Okay, cool.

Yeah.

I'm just gonna set this one to be 45 minutes. I'm gonna try to keep it to 30, but I'm gonna be a little more acknowledgement that it might take a little longer. Um.

Does that sound good?

Yes. Okay, cool.

Um, and then, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna try to do a little, a lot better job of getting back to my messages, um, on Discord, um, so if you also just need anything, or have any questions, um, just message me, and then if I don't get back to you, I probably read it, and was looking at something, and just forgot, so just please message me again, um, cause, I might forget, and I feel really bad, um, but, but See ya.

Okay, I'm gonna let you know.

Awesome. Talk soon, JP. Thank you so much for the time tonight.

Of course.

Good night.

Night. Night.
