# JP 1:1 Summary — January 28, 2026

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), JP (Mod)
**Purpose:** February schedule review, mission/vision walkthrough, company goals overview, staff payment restructure, KPI setting

---

## February Schedule

JP shared his February work schedule. He works at a hospital in patient admitting and is still in training, which ends in about two weeks. His February schedule is inconsistent:

- Week of Feb 2: 7am-3pm shifts
- Week of Feb 9-13: Mixed shifts including a double (class from 12am-6am, then 3pm-11pm shift), a 12pm-8pm Friday
- Week of Feb 16: Virtual training (time TBD), stays home but gets paid. Also an 11pm-7am overnight
- Week of Feb 23: More virtual training at home

JP mentioned he worked a 13-hour shift on Monday due to the blizzard — half his team called out and he stayed 11pm to 3pm the next day, then came back for a 7am-3pm the following day. Once training ends, his schedule will stabilize to consistent 11pm-7am overnight shifts, freeing up daytime availability.

## Routine App — Company Workspace

Dax introduced Routine, a notes app he's using as the company workspace. He's created a Dropout Degens organization with workspaces for company home, marketing, development, education, and operations. The partner database is loaded with all partner information including age restrictions, codes, offers, and conversion point values. Staff will be able to copy partner info directly to share in Discord.

Dax is not adding JP to Routine yet because current permissions allow anyone to create/edit content, which risks corruption. Routine is releasing view-only permissions within the week — once that ships, JP will get access to everything except the operations workspace.

## Mission and Vision

Dax walked through the company's three-stage journey:

- **Year 1:** Grew from 0 to 2,500 members organically through the Fliff server. Secured about five partnerships. Learned about user demographics and partnership viability.
- **Year 2:** Scaled partnerships but did not scale conversions proportionally. Did well with some social sportsbooks (Rebet, Thrills) but failed to convert broadly.
- **Year 3 (current):** Repositioning as education-first. Showing members the actual value of partnerships through tools (Outlier, OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy, Props Cache). Framing shifted from "use our code for free days" to "add this sportsbook to your arsenal for line shopping" with free access as a secondary benefit.

The goal is to make members into analysts themselves — equipping them with resources and knowledge to fact-check analyst picks and find their own bets. Dax wants to personalize resources based on betting style (straight vs parlay, DFS vs sportsbook, new vs experienced).

JP responded positively but raised a concern: most active members are now 21+ and DD doesn't have partnerships with major sportsbooks yet. Dax said those partnerships will be lined up the moment he turns 21 in February.

## Company Goals

Dax presented 15 high-level goals broken into Q1 and Q2 evaluation periods. Key Q1 goals:

1. **Differentiate Discord positioning** — Finish the education-first pivot. Update all content, commands, resources, and onboarding. Target: done by the Super Bowl.
2. **Raise pricing to $50/month** — Validates the offer. New offer: 7 free days per partner signup, 30 free days for signing up with three partners.
3. **Expand Discord resources** — Three waves: (1) additional tools/markets now, (2) sportsbooks when Dax turns 21, (3) more tools like Props Madness.
4. **Acquire another community** — Pay through revenue share. Brings new analyst(s), mods, and a test population for the education-first approach.
5. **Improve server retention** — Get the community active. Use February 1st through the Super Bowl as a push period.
6. **Staff culture adoption** — Staff internalize the education-first mindset. Natural education instead of sales-pushing partner codes.
7. **Staff KPIs and contractor agreements** — Formalize responsibilities and compensation structure.
8. **Weekly staff meetings** — Establish recurring meeting cadence.
9. **Optimize conversion funnel** — Ongoing development of partner promo bot automation and conversion tracking.

Work is organized into three waves: Wave 1 (now through Super Bowl), Wave 2 (Super Bowl through end of February), Wave 3 (March onward for marketing).

## Dante Discussion

JP asked directly about Dante's status. Dax expressed frustration — Dante sent the play of the day at 12:41pm that day, which Dax couldn't post because he was heading to class. Dax acknowledged he also bears responsibility for not posting it once he saw it (he opened the DM, got distracted, and forgot). Dax said he still needs to get on a call with Dante and that Dante's compensation allocation is contingent on that conversation. He noted Dante doesn't send picks anymore and doesn't talk on the server.

## Analyst Posting

JP said he wants to post picks but doesn't have time to consistently research. He described getting into a groove for one or two days, missing one day, and falling off entirely. He also said he sometimes forces picks when he feels obligated, which produces worse results. Dax acknowledged if analysts aren't sending plays, it's hard to push for community engagement.

Dax mentioned a fallback: over the summer, he could be the sole analyst if the staff approach doesn't work. That's not the preferred path.

## Conversion Points System

Dax detailed the conversion tracking and incentive system:

- **Free access tickets:** When a member creates a free access ticket, whichever mod handles the conversion and gets them signed up on a partner earns the points.
- **Partner promo bot:** When a member clicks "claim now" on a partner, a ticket is created. Mods compete (first-come) to handle it.
- **Invite links:** All staff get tracked invite links through the Dropout Degens bot. If a member joins through JP's link, JP gets the same points as the mod who converts them — double points if JP both invited and converted them.
- **Point values:** Vary by partner (3 points for most, up to 10 for Parlay Play, WannaParlay, Sleeper).

## Staff Payment Restructure

Dax outlined the new compensation model:

- **20% of monthly revenue** goes directly to a bonus pool, distributed monthly based on conversion points earned
- **80% of monthly revenue** is the base — staff get their percentage out of this 80%
- **Head staff allocation (10% total):** 4% for JP, 4% for Dante (contingent on Dante call), 2% for Zach
- **Eligibility requirement (under consideration):** Staff must complete at least 5 conversions per month to receive their base percentage. Under 5, they only receive bonus pool distribution.

Dax acknowledged revenue is very low — about $40 every other week from subscriptions, no partnership revenue claimed yet. He has $500-600 in unclaimed partner bonuses that will be claimed in February.

## Props Tools Discussion

JP shared his screen showing Props Madness and raised concerns about readability for new bettors. Dax agreed and outlined the approach: start members with the free Props Cache bot integration, then graduate them to a Props Cache subscription, then to Props Madness for advanced users. The framing is educational progression, not sales.

JP suggested he could share Props Madness screenshots or repost their Instagram picks. Dax agreed and set this as a KPI.

## KPIs Set

Four tasks assigned to JP:

1. **Post daily poll** — Required daily. JP will post during work break (10am-12pm) or after shift. Dax will send the weekly game schedule. Super Bowl poll is mandatory.
2. **Manage open support tickets** — Check and respond to support tickets across all categories. Tag Dax or Bellcube as needed.
3. **Share a props tool daily** — Post a Props Madness screenshot or use the Props Cache bot. Goal is engagement around the tool.
4. **Create discussion in 5 unique channels daily** — Not strictly required but high impact.

Top priorities through Super Bowl: daily poll and managing support tickets.

## Next Steps

- Weekly meetings established: Tuesdays at 4pm, starting next week
- Dax to send JP weekly Layup game schedule for poll content
- JP to receive Routine access once view-only permissions ship
- Dax to schedule calls with Dante, Kayden, Nanu, and analysts (Kronos, Poro, Luke)
- Dax meeting with Zach on Saturday at 10am to fix Fliff EV bot and welcome tickets
