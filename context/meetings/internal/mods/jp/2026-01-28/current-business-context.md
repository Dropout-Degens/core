# Business Context — As of January 28, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is repositioning from a picks-focused Discord to an education-first sports betting community. The Discord does not yet fully reflect the education-first positioning — content, channels, and onboarding still need updates. The community is currently inactive. Dax described needing about 20 active premium members chatting every day for the server to feel alive. The target is to have the education-first pivot complete by the Super Bowl.

The company has been through three stages:
- Year 1: Grew from 0 to 2,500 members organically through the Fliff server, secured first partnerships
- Year 2: Scaled partnerships but failed to scale conversions proportionally
- Year 3: Current education-first repositioning

## Team

- **Dax (CEO):** Managing everything, balancing full-time job and school. Junior year. Struggles to post analyst picks consistently due to time constraints. Cannot be signed in to Canva for Dropout Degens on all laptops, which creates friction for posting play of the day graphics.
- **JP (Mod):** Works at a hospital in patient admitting. Currently in training with an inconsistent February schedule. Training ends in ~2 weeks, then schedule stabilizes to 11pm-7am overnight shifts with daytime availability.
- **Dante (Head Analyst):** Status uncertain. Sent play of the day late (12:41pm) on the day of this meeting. Does not post picks anymore and does not talk on the server. Dax needs to have a call with him. His 4% compensation allocation is contingent on that conversation.
- **Zach (Developer):** Handles bot development. Meeting scheduled for Saturday at 10am to fix Fliff EV bot and welcome tickets.
- **Prospective staff:** Dax is scheduling onboarding calls with Kayden, Nanu, and potentially one other person. Also needs to schedule analyst calls with Kronos, Poro, and Luke.

## Revenue

- Subscription revenue is minimal — approximately $40 every other week
- No partnership revenue has been claimed recently
- $500-600 in unclaimed partner bonuses will be claimed in February
- Current subscription price: $15/month, planned increase to $50/month
- LTV per customer: approximately $1,200-1,500 across all partnerships, increasing to ~$2,000 when Dax turns 21 in February and major sportsbook partnerships become available
- At $50 CPA per partner conversion and $1-2 acquisition cost per user, only need ~2% conversion to break even

## Product State

- **Fliff EV bot:** Broken. Filters are not working correctly, not sending alerts as intended. Zach meeting on Saturday to fix.
- **Welcome tickets:** Broken. The fix Zach pushed didn't work. Will be addressed in Saturday meeting.
- **EV channels:** Need cleanup. Dax plans to delete old data, create new channels, keep only hockey with historical reference for demonstrating past filter performance.
- **Partner promo bot:** Exists but not fully built out. Claim-to-ticket automation planned.
- **Props Cache bot:** Integrated but underutilized. Free for members to use in the Discord.
- **Routine (company workspace):** Dax is building out the company knowledge base here. Partner database loaded. Staff will get access once view-only permissions ship (expected this week).
- **Tracked invite links:** Now functional through Dropout Degens bot via Supabase.

## Partnerships

- 25+ current partnerships loaded into database with age restrictions, codes, offers, and point values
- Integrated tools: Props Cache, Outlier, OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy
- Props Madness mentioned as a potential partnership (not yet confirmed)
- Major sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM) will be available once Dax turns 21 in February

## Staff Compensation Structure

- 20% of monthly revenue goes to bonus pool, distributed by conversion points
- 80% of monthly revenue distributed as base percentage to staff
- Head staff allocation (10% total): 4% JP, 4% Dante (contingent), 2% Zach
- Eligibility requirement under consideration: 5 conversions minimum to receive base percentage
- Points earned via: free access ticket conversions, partner promo bot claims, tracked invite link referrals
- Double points if staff member both invites and converts a user

## Strategic Direction

1. **Wave 1 (now through Super Bowl):** Complete education-first pivot. Get all content, commands, resources, and onboarding updated. Push for community activity.
2. **Wave 2 (Super Bowl through end of February):** Stabilize features, raise pricing to $50/month, build retention infrastructure.
3. **Wave 3 (March onward):** Marketing push, community acquisition, scaling.

Primary focus is getting the Discord ready so that when new members arrive (through marketing or community acquisition), they have something to come into. The server currently does not reflect the education-first positioning, and staff engagement correlates with the founder's limited availability.

## Key Blockers

- Developer availability limiting feature development pace (Fliff EV broken, welcome tickets broken)
- Staff engagement is low — analysts not posting, Dante's status uncertain
- Discord does not yet reflect education-first positioning
- No active conversion funnel in place
- Revenue is minimal, making it hard to motivate staff with compensation
