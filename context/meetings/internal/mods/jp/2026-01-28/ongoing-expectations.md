# JP Ongoing Expectations — As of January 28, 2026

## Role

Moderator (Head Staff)

## Current Schedule

JP works at a hospital in patient admitting. He started in mid-January and is still in training, which ends in about two weeks. His February schedule is inconsistent with a mix of 7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm, 12pm-8pm, and 11pm-7am shifts, plus virtual training days staying home in the last two weeks of February. Once training ends, his schedule will stabilize to consistent 11pm-7am overnight shifts, freeing up daytime hours for Discord engagement.

## Current Expectations

- **Daily poll:** Post the daily poll every day. During work weeks, post during break (10am-12pm) or after shift. Dax will send the weekly Layup game schedule so JP doesn't have to choose games. The Super Bowl poll is mandatory.

- **Support ticket management:** Monitor and respond to open support tickets across all categories — general support, free access, subscription help, partnership inquiry, and bug reports. Tag Dax or Bellcube as needed. Primary responsibility is ensuring no ticket goes unanswered. Other mods share this responsibility, but JP manages the system.

- **Props tool sharing:** Share a props tool daily — either a Props Madness screenshot or use the Props Cache bot in the server. The goal is community engagement around the tools, not necessarily direct conversions.

- **Channel engagement:** Create discussion in 5 unique channels daily. Not strictly required but high impact. Be present and generate conversation.

- **Education-first framing:** When recommending partners or tools, frame it around the member's specific need and educational value. The approach is conversational — understand what kind of bettor they are, what tools fit their level, and guide them through a progression (Props Cache bot first, then Props Cache subscription, then Props Madness for advanced users).

- **Feedback:** Provide feedback to Dax on what's working and what's not with the ticket system, since it's new.

- **Weekly meetings:** Attend weekly 1:1 with Dax on Tuesdays at 4pm.

## Priority Order (Now Through Super Bowl)

1. Post daily poll
2. Manage open support tickets
3. Props tool sharing
4. Channel engagement

## Compensation

- **Base:** 4% of monthly revenue (out of the 80% after the 20% bonus pool is taken off the top)
- **Bonus pool:** 20% of monthly revenue distributed proportionally based on conversion points earned. Points come from partner conversions in free access tickets, partner promo bot claims, and invite link referrals.
- **Double points:** If JP both invites a member (via tracked link) and converts them in a ticket, he receives points for both.
- **Eligibility requirement (under consideration):** May need to complete at least 5 conversions per month to receive the base 4%. Under 5, only the bonus pool payout applies.

## Unique Considerations

- JP's hospital training schedule makes his February availability unpredictable. Expectations are calibrated to what he can manage around shifting work hours.
- JP has personal knowledge of Props Madness and uses it for his own betting, making him effective at sharing props tool content authentically.
- JP expressed interest in posting analyst picks but acknowledged he cannot commit to consistent research time. He is a mod, not an analyst.
- Overnight shifts (11pm-7am) mean JP will be available on his phone during dead hours but community activity will be low then. His primary engagement window is daytime before work.
