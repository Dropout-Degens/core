# JP — Current Context

**Last Updated:** January 28, 2026
**Role:** Moderator (Head Staff)
**Status:** Active — ramping up as schedule stabilizes

---

## Background

JP works at a hospital in patient admitting. He started mid-January 2026 and is still in training, which ends in about two weeks from the Jan 28 meeting. Once training ends, his schedule will stabilize to consistent 11pm-7am overnight shifts, freeing up daytime hours for Discord engagement.

His February 2026 schedule is inconsistent:
- Week of Feb 2: 7am-3pm shifts
- Week of Feb 9-13: Mixed shifts including a double (class 12am-6am, then 3pm-11pm shift)
- Week of Feb 16: Virtual training (time TBD), stays home, gets paid. Also an 11pm-7am overnight.
- Week of Feb 23: More virtual training at home

He's been dealing with chaos — worked a 13-hour shift during the blizzard (11pm to 3pm next day) when half his team called out, then came back for a 7am-3pm the following day. Had to climb through a window to shovel out his snowed-in door.

## Current Expectations

**Four assigned tasks (as of Jan 28):**

1. **Post daily poll** — Required daily. Post during work break (10am-12pm) or after shift. Dax sends weekly Layup game schedule. **Super Bowl poll is mandatory.**

2. **Manage open support tickets** — Check and respond across all categories (general support, free access, subscription help, partnership inquiry, bug reports). Tag Dax or Bellcube as needed. Primary responsibility is ensuring no ticket goes unanswered.

3. **Share a props tool daily** — Post a Props Madness screenshot or use the Props Cache bot. Goal is engagement around tools, not necessarily conversions.

4. **Create discussion in 5 unique channels daily** — Not strictly required but high impact.

**Priority order (through Super Bowl):**
1. Daily poll
2. Support tickets
3. Props tool sharing
4. Channel engagement

**Other:**
- Weekly 1:1 with Dax on Tuesdays at 4pm
- Provide feedback on what's working/not working with the ticket system

## Compensation

- **Base:** 4% of monthly revenue (out of the 80% after 20% bonus pool is taken off top)
- **Bonus pool:** 20% of revenue distributed by conversion points. Points from partner conversions, promo bot claims, invite link referrals.
- **Double points:** If JP both invites and converts someone.
- **Eligibility requirement (under consideration):** May need 5 conversions/month to receive base 4%. Under 5 = only bonus pool payout.

## Access & Setup

- [x] February work schedule logged in Dax's calendar
- [ ] Access to Routine company workspace (pending view-only permissions release)
- [ ] Tracked invite link set up
- [ ] Formalized compensation documents

## Unique Considerations

- Hospital training schedule makes February availability unpredictable
- Has personal knowledge of Props Madness and uses it for his own betting
- Expressed interest in posting analyst picks but can't commit to consistent research time — he's a mod, not an analyst
- Overnight shifts (11pm-7am) mean he's available on phone during dead hours but community activity is low then

## Analyst Aspirations

JP mentioned he wants to post picks but doesn't have time to consistently research. He gets into a groove for one or two days, misses one day, and falls off. He also forces picks when he feels obligated, which produces worse results. For now, he's focused on mod duties.
