But I've been good. I've been working through everything. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, bro. School's treating you well? Or, like, what's...

Uh, yeah, I'm liking it, but, like, I'm low-key not doing the best grade-wise, but, like, it's, like, it is what it is. Oh, I feel you, bro.

I feel you.

But I'm also working with Layup, so I guess you have a good conversation with them?

Yeah, man, it was good. I got a little freaked out. They were like, hey, what bank do you use? I was like, hold on. I was like, wait, what do you mean? But everything else was pretty chill. They had me in there for about 45 minutes. It was a good conversation.

No, that's good. Yeah, they're like a fintech company. So the bank question was literally probably just like, they don't care what bank you use at all. It's just like, do they have this in their system? Sure.

Yeah, no, I got you. My bank's real niche, so I don't know if they would or not.

Yeah, there's a bunch of banks like that. But honestly, I love the guys there. They're really good to talk to, and they love what they're building in the sports betting space. And it's kind of helping bettors when it comes to either saving money. Well, maybe not as much right now, but that's what they're kind of building towards.

Yeah, yeah, how long you been with them?

So almost a year now actually I started interning with them about like March last last year and I stuck with it all the way through like that in my semester till last semester and through now Yeah, is it a paid internship or just learning? Yeah, it's a paid internship, which is great because definitely would be a lot if it was just not paid and with school and also job at DJs.

Oh, yeah, no. For sure, bro. So like, so, so I know you've been talking about repositioning, like tell me a little bit about it.

You know what I'm saying? Like what, what's, what's your plan? Yeah, so I guess like really when it comes to like I guess like I'll take a step back and like kind of break it down to like where we are in this space because we've kind of like we've been around for three years, but I would say that like we're kind of just like a bit dead right now, but it's not like it's actually just not something that I'm like concerned about.

But the way I would put it is like Travel DGENs has kind of had like three unique stages of growth. In year one, we just like broke off from the Fluff server. So we were just working on scaling our users. And so we got to like about 3000 members in our first year, which helped us to build our partnerships. And kind of in year two, we scaled our like three to five partnerships to about like 25. So we now have 25 partnerships.

Yeah, it's kind of crazy. And so what we did in that time was, It was kind of this was through last year so we kind of didn't we've been mostly organic through marketing so we've never just these partners and really actually bring value to our members. So that kind of brings us to where I am now. So our community is kind of dead. We don't have that much going on right now. But what we are doing is we're building into, we're trying to just position to be more education first.

And when you think of all of the sports betting discords and kind of the niche, everybody's goal is to just send their members profitable picks. They're just paying to tail something. So we want to kind of tailor our goal to be, yes, we'll have the panelist picks, yes, we'll have that, but it'll also just be built into the community as in we're going to frame our resources at our partnerships as well to be like these are not only the resources that you have but we are actually going to teach you how to use them and the strategies behind why.

So kind of like with our analyst picks, our analysts are sending plays but it's also the you should take it because I did x y and z for this research and then it's kind of like you can understand how to replicate that on your own. Sure. Yeah. So like, yeah, so. Really just trying to make that the front of our positioning to just be these are how you use our partnerships and then also equip them with the knowledge and strategies and like actual education behind why they should be using this partner for example when it comes to odds jam like we can actually i'll use props cache as a better one so we have two partners that i would say are a good example for this operation into the server right now.

So we have Owlire Insights that send trends daily. And then we have the PropsCast bot that is just the last five plays. But the kind of positioning that we're tailoring around is that we have these insights. And so not only can you use these insights to validate our analyst plays, but you can use them to actually do the research on your own. comfortable with this tool and finding success with the integrations we have in our Discord, that's kind of where you should take the step and actually look at the tool yourself.

And that's where our partnership codes come in as well.

Yeah, yeah, for sure. Now I see that you keep saying we, like, so I'm assuming you got some other people that are in this with you, like behind the scenes. Am I right or?

Yeah, so I'm kind of like the staff is a little bit depreciated and I would just say that because it's been a little hard for the management wise because when we really just grew our partnerships, we didn't really change our philosophy at all. We were just mostly focusing on the analyst picks and our team members weren't really focusing on conversions. So like everything they did wasn't really converting to revenue and we just, a block there and didn't really grow in revenue.

And so we kind of lost some of our analysts. So right now, I have some of the team behind me, but I'm also working on rebuilding to get more team members on board.

Sure, yeah, 100%. I mean, estimation, I guess right now, how many people you got on your side.

I got about five to ten, but their activity is just not always the best engagement. But I'm like... I tried to get everybody back in about a month ago, but we just weren't ready on like... the positioning and actually like what the staff needs to be able to like understand that positioning. So I kind of like onboarded them a month early and they kind of just trickled out because we didn't also have many members coming in as well.

So it's kind of just like, it's kind of just a weird situation for me. Like I need to get it in a good place where everything's going and the staff's going at the same time.

Yeah, for sure. I mean, bro, you're in college. Like, I mean, it's already impressive enough. You've gone where you've gone. I mean, I don't know if you started this pre-college. I would assume maybe high school. Or maybe freshman year, but it's already impressive where you've gotten it at. I've been in the Discord since 2013, so I've been there for pretty much all of it, I would say. Maybe... but Yeah, you definitely got a lot going right now, and I see you're doing it.

predominantly by yourself, which is very impressive.

Yeah, that's been, yeah, you've been here since like basically day one of the cord and yeah, it's been, it has definitely been hard because I guess the way I would say is like business developmentally wise, it's only been me. I have one developer, but he also has a job, so he's like part-time, so, and he doesn't really do half the shit I ask him, so it's basically like, it's just me, and then all the like when I say we in the staff like that's just like daily engagement in the court and like it's been I would say it's been a battle for me just managing to get the daily engagement and the actual business development focusing on both of those at the same time it's like just extremely struggle struggle something for sure I mean you say you say you're rebranding Assuming you're keeping the same name, are we switching that up or what's your game plan?

So I'm going to keep the same dropout DGN's name and brand, I think. I don't think it's the strongest, but I also don't think it's anything that's too bad. And we also kind of have somewhat of a name in the space. I wouldn't say that big of a name, but we are somewhat known. So I guess we're just mostly tailoring it to... The best way I would say is we're teaching you how to drop your degenerate gambling habits and actually approach sports betting smarter.

mottos and like also With like I guess the overall community positioning with like how we are We want every member to be like an analyst of their own kind of like the way I would say is like we kind of want to sell a course on how to like if any of these guys wanted to they could create their own betting discord and sell it if they wanted to. But we kind of just want it to be the course of like, an analyst.

Yeah. But I guess when it comes to branding it, I don't think we're going to brand it as a course. We're just going to keep it as a community, but a community focused on education.

Yeah, for sure. I mean, have you thought about like dropout DJs B2? Yeah, like anything like that? Or just like, how are you going to revamp? Obviously, you have a bunch of members in there. I've seen the member numbers. But yeah, obviously, you don't have the activity that you're wanting at the moment. Like, you're not going with a clean slate because, you know, you're keeping the same name and whatnot.

How are you going to, like– Just completely revamp it. What is your strategy? Because I know what you want the end goal to be, what you want to tailor it to, but what do you have right now that you're like, this is what I'm going to do to reYeah, so I have a couple of things working for me.

So one thing that I want to mention is that our customer like LTV, and this is like potential LTV and it's not a like average number, but our customer LTV with our partnerships currently is about like $1,400. And that's just from partnerships and not subscriptions at all. And so just if they sign up through all of our partnerships, we would receive a minimum of $1,400. for value, and that's just through CPAs.

which is just like if they deposit we get paid. And so What? We're... really like able to do is I guess there's three things I'm looking at is one is a community re-engagement, but that's not really something that I really care that much about. Two is a community acquisition. I have a couple of different communities that one I'm talking with and two I'm looking at to just merge over and then I would just give their basically how it works is instead of them having to buy in or me having to pay for them what I would do is just give them a percentage of the dropout DGENs revenue so they'd get in for like probably four or five percent and that's just like of our monthly revenue and then they would bring the community members over and that would be how we could just get an active community again.

And then the third thing is, which we don't wanna focus on it until we find like, the way I would phrase it is, product market fit but the best way I would say is like until we find out that we can get a good return on ad spend from our customers but we can basically afford to pay a lot of money for our users into the server since they can generate and with that $1,400 number I'm only 20 right now so in about two weeks that's gonna jump hugely and then we're also gonna add more partners to our list so I expect that to be about $2,000 to $2,500 So what we can do is we can afford to pay like five bucks.

I mean, we've been paying 25 cents per customer on our previous listings. So that's extremely cheap. And it was pretty well for us for us to scale organically. But we can just take it to meta ads and we can afford to actually pay like one to five dollars per customer and have a good return. And we just need to get a pretty low conversion rate to actually. success in that. And so that's what we're going to be looking at.

Oh yeah, no, for sure. I mean, right. You said fourteen hundred right now. It's like what you're how many how many is that based off strictly sponsorships? Does that also include like premium pay?

No, so with premium pay, I wouldn't even– so like also the way I would phrase our demographic that– and why I'm also not that inclined in a– community, like, um, engagement is that a lot of our demographic, if you look in the general chat, like a lot of these people are like a sweater. So But we've already lost them and they've already churned. So they were these flip users that don't really know how to bet.

So they would be perfect users for our Discord. But we want to find product market fit a little bit better before we kind of re-engage them. And it's also one of those things that as they get more tags in the server, they'll kind of just get re-engaged over time as well without us having to solely focus on that campaign.

you Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, how many customers, like out of the members that you have right now, How many would you say are... still active in some regard?

On a monthly basis, we probably have about 50 to 100. We're really not that active.

Yeah, scraping right now. I mean, what and what'd you say? projection by March.

Honestly, like... were It really depends on how we can, like, I'm not really too sure on our timelines. That's one of the things I've been struggling with, just because everything takes a lot longer, either when I'm doing it by myself or having to rely on somebody else to push it to prod for me. True. I guess timeline wise, really, I'm expecting us to... We have about like... until the Super Bowl to finish our getting our education information updated and then we're really going to focus on a little bit of re-engagement and then we're gonna be looking for that community acquisition and just kind of like looking to scale from there Yeah, yeah.

Damn, I just lost the question I had. Oh, oh yeah. Are you still running? The social medias, I remember you used to have an Instagram page. Like, is that still something that's going on or has that died off as well?

No, I handed it off to somebody else and then it died off and I haven't brought it back on. I haven't just put it in my thing, but we do. It is something that we are interested in and are going to.

It's just like a planning thing. And we also for our marketing, we just have to finish like our education first positioning. I guess like, yeah. Um.

Since you're driving, I'm not going to set up a screen share for this for you, but another thing that I have is...

I'm getting all this stuff, but basically, It's been hard for the staff to, since we have so many resources, really delegate and kind of understand like how the best way is to convert on those resources.

So another thing that I'm doing is I use this app called Routine. It's just like a calendar app, but I basically, and it's also kind of like Notion, but I've loaded up all of our Dropout DJENS, like basically information in there. So I'm going to be giving our staff access to this, which will help them like make better conversions for us.

Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean... If you need help with the Instagram or whatnot, uh, I'm more than willing to, to step up to that plate. And when I run I run my dad's business Instagram. And my, my girlfriend, I know I've mentioned her to you a few times she's she's a social media, like influencer she's she's like 140,000 on TikTok. She's She's a part of an e-sports team for gaming and stuff. Like she's big into the social media space.

So she knows how to work a lot of that. A lot of the social media game. So she gives me a little bit of knowledge as well. Um, So if you ever need a hand with that, I'm more than willing. I think it'd be fun to do. So I'd be more than willing to help with that if it is needed. But I mean, as far as like... You made a point and I'm trying to remember the verbiage that you use, but I don't know if you've ever seen better them as a company, how they use people like Derek.

I don't know if you know who I'm talking about, but like... to their company. Has that been like a... idea where you use people as like the face of like the brand to use promotions on like TikTok and Instagram and stuff or Yeah, that's a good question.

So honestly, when it comes to putting a face to really like things, I like I honestly, I'm we're just not even on social media. So it hasn't like changed. I mean, it's come to mind, but it hasn't been something that we've followed through on. But honestly, like...

I'm awful at social... I'm actually so awful at social media content. So, like, I don't think I would be a good face. But it is something that we're completely... I was also looking at, like, faceless content through... But it doesn't... Like, when it comes to social media, we have, like... The full plate's open.

Oh, yeah. you know, everything's on the table for sure. Okay. Yeah, social media. I mean, obviously it's huge for, for marketing. I apologize if you're, I think my audio cuts out here and there. I've been hearing you cut out a little bit. So that's on me. I'm on the highway just in traffic, but, um, Uh... Uh, Yeah, I mean, obviously, you know this. I can just tell by the way you're talking, you're using words that even some of the words I don't know, business scheme.

And I'm like, wow, holy, this man knows what he's talking about. Yeah, I mean, social media is obviously... a big way for marketing. And I know you said you were going to use use meta ads or that is the plan is to you know, use meta ads as well to help with customer conversion and stuff. But, I mean, like I said, social media, obviously, you need a hand. I can– I can definitely help you.

Yeah, so I guess that is definitely something that we will need a hand on. And then I'll circle back to the one point of... Like, we need to have, before we, like, focus on our social media and also just, like, paid marketing, we just, my one thing is I want to have an active community for that. So people who, like, do find us have people that they come into. So, like, is... I guess like timeline wise, like I would say once we have like 20 or so daily active members that are able to send something in our channels, then like I'm, And we're going for social media.

And that's probably like a super low goal and really easily tangible. But I guess like our hardest problem has just been the retention of things.

Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, I remember obviously like 20, 2023, I was in that discord all times of the day. I was in there like, oh, what are people chopping up about? This and that. So it's definitely something that is tangible, that can be picked up again. It's been done. It's worked. It's possible for sure. I mean, even I still look at the discord, like I've been doing it today. I'll look at the discord, see what to arena saying or sweater saying, um, I think it's fun when you have other people, especially like me.

Like, I don't really have a lot of like personal friends that I can like toss information off of or like, That's why when I'm texting you about my NBA stuff, I'm geeking out because no one else that I'm super tight with really gets it like I do. So I think that like, That's something people will definitely be looking for if they're into it. More than just... the gambling part of it, you know?

Yeah, exactly. And I guess like, kind of like, with... With my work at Layup, I've been exposed a lot, one, to just the startup.

When I say a bunch of random shit that doesn't make sense, it's probably from Layup and their startup terminology that I'm just transferring.

But it's been really...

We've been speaking to a lot of bettors, and it's really interesting to just speak to them.

Really, everybody...

is everybody that we talk to is just like, they have, all these They have all these strategies and resources but like they don't have a place that they talk about and like when they are in these discords, they're just kind of like just tailing the pics that are sent from the people from them and then when they don't do well they blame the people and just keep telling them blindly when it's like you have the strategies as well and you have the knowledge to do these things yourselves and also share Kind of like...

That knowledge just the the sharing of knowledge is just something that Kind of like what you said earlier just like makes me excited to like actually chop it up with people that are knowledgeable like Especially like with Reina in general track because she's a super I would consider her very knowledgeable better It's kind of just funny to see the education aspect of like the education of sweating Thank you.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, I like that. That is like that to me is my favorite part. Like I was trying to tell my girlfriend, she's like, I have no idea what the hell you're saying right now, but it sounds like, damn it. Like I want to talk to somebody about this that like, you know, gets it, can bounce off. Like the way that I always tackled the discord, like back when it was like super active and stuff like that.

And I was in there as I would do my research first. And then I go see what other people think about it. And see if like maybe I'm on the right track or people are like everybody's against something that I have. Like they're just like, no, no, no. I'd be like, okay, let me reassess. Let me see if maybe my outlook on it is skewed or if maybe I just see something that no one else has seen. I think that's a huge part of it that I'm hyped for to see happen in the Discord world.

Yeah, and I miss it so much of like having that active chord like, like it, I just watched it kind of like drop off over the summer and then over the semester I was too busy to like keep it going it was kind of just so sad to see like, just, I miss that just chopping up about that like just sharing of knowledge and just actually people who know what they're talking about and like validating for like before you like place it having that extra confidence yeah yeah no exactly like it's it's it's like i remember i approached you with the ladder challenge i see it's still something in there which is so fucking sick um i I remember DMing you or maybe it was someone else, but I think it was you.

I DMed about the ladder challenge and I was like, this week was hell. Like everyone can ride it together. Like I, I love that. I love when everyone was riding like the ladder, everyone was sweating it together. Like, you know, that, that sense of community, like you said. And, um, That's why I approached you about the channel was One of the parts was because all this research that I was doing, I just wanted to share it.

I wanted to put it out there for people. And I just don't have that outlet. You know what I'm saying? my girlfriend is not going to not going to make anything of it. So that's, that's why I was like, yo, like, I just want to get it out there. I just want people to see like, I guess the work that I'm doing like by myself, like and see if like it pays off because it seems like it is, you know.

Yeah, exactly. um like with with dropout djens like it's been and also just like the aspect of just sharing like your plays and having them people ride them and it's like your work is being taken by others as well and use um and like from we stopped tracking our greened out plays and like we only tracked in 2023 or like we did less than a year but we had like over 500 000 in community wins like that were shared in our greened out server which is like incredible like to look at and think about it's like all the wins that our members are getting together Oh, yeah.

It's insane. Yesterday, when I was at work, I work at Outback. I told my manager, I said, I'm telling you right now, he's a big sports guy. He loves betting on sports. I said, Pacers and Knicks money line, parlay it. And he texted me at like 11 o'clock or 10 o'clock when the games ended. And he was like, yo, I just turned 50 to 200. And I was like, do I get a raise? And he said, no. I was like, oh, okay, all right.

No, you should definitely get a raise.

I'm saying bro I just made you 150 come on man but I was like that like last night especially was so big to me like because I had I've had two upsets predicted by my model both have hit last night I had two in the same night and they both hit and it was like it was the biggest like reassurance my whole leap I might be like on to something I think I made 4.7 units or so I have to add it up I made a crazy unit return yesterday off of or five bets, I had five bets, but two of them, I had the Pacers plus two and Pacers money line, which kind of work together.

If the Pacers win, obviously the other one's going to work, but like, It was just crazy like seeing that turn out so I was like ah I'm doing something right There's especially like with your model like there's nothing more validating than like it predicting it and then it's actually being right and especially on those like the upsets or like the crazy odds like those are like the best feelings Oh exactly Also another thing that we have, it's kind of hidden right now, but we've been, I don't know if you remember it, but we've still been collecting Ajjam EV.

So we still have Ajjam EV and we have Daily Grind Fantasy. And so we've been collecting the data points for like basically two years now.

And so we're trying to build out filters on top of their algorithm basically.

they rate it with an EV score.

And so we can take their EV score and say, like, because their EV score is essentially, oh, we think this is going to hit at 60%. And so we can, like, look at all their EV scores and say, when they think it's going to hit at 60%, with a couple of other factors, they're actually right, like, 80% of the time. So what we're going to be doing with our Odds Jam EV is we're going to be just, it's kind of like kind of a model, but we're going to be filtering out just the high-performing markets because they send us like 2,000 a day.

So we're just going to try to send out like five to ten of the best plays that we get every day.

Oh yeah. Yeah, no, I've followed odds jam like for because they do a lot of arbitrage betting, which I I haven't done. Oh. But I mean, I'm sure that's part of that probably will be part of the education aspect as well.

Oh, yeah. I love arbitrage. And even just the arbitrage of finding a live bet to hedge and secure profit is just...

Those are...

Oh, yeah, no, hedging is so huge. I did that last night. I literally did that last night because I had– I had Pacers and Knicks money line, but then I had Raptors minus two and a half. Cause that was like the other pick I had. Um, And it was like 25 to 160 that I had on there. And first two cash, I put 25 on Spurs plus three and a half for like $57. And that last leg lost. So I basically, I technically only made $7 profit, but I secured myself from not losing $25.

I made it back with, I guess, what a fucking Starbucks coffee. Not a lot, but I made it back.

on just like the last leg and securing oh yeah exactly like last night oh my the flyers were losing 3-1 last night and what i do for nhl is i love to look for teams that are like down by two or three goals and i just love to like hit their money line um because they're like plus like a thousand and it's actually like i love it i like doing this better than parlays because it's like more realistic than a parlay um and i forgot to do it last night um but the flyers were down 3-1 Like...

they were down 3-1 and I was like damn I probably should have done it and they were plus like 850 and I was like nah they're not gonna come back and they ended up coming back 3-3 but like it's always those situations where it's like that perfect hedge like because plus 800 and now the odds are even so it's like a free a free plus 400 swing or plus 400 odds swing no matter what Oh yeah, yeah, no, that's, I actually have a side question because I noticed that you have a sponsorship for it.

with my NBA strategy, I was looking sports books limit you when you've went too much. Um, I haven't gotten to that point, but if my NBA strategy keeps going the way it does and I keep making profit from it, because I think I'm up 17 units right now, somewhere around there, 17, 18 units. If it keeps working that way and I do end up getting limited and in a ideal world where I'm so damn good making so damn so much money and I'm limited on every sports book in Florida, I seen that bet 105 is one of the sports books that are like the odds makers that won't limit you.

Um... If you're winning so but I don't know if that's true. I don't know how that works I just seen that you are sponsored for it. So just curious if you know a little bit about it.

So they're an offshore website. So they're like a bookie. So they don't really...

We just added them back into our partnership list because everything got banned in California. So we want to add a little bit more in there.

But essentially what they are is just an offshore website. I think they're crypto deposit. I don't remember which, but they're they. They'll completely take your action. They're super happy for Arbors. If you have something on DraftKings and you get it on Fandle for minus 107, you might want to take it on this app because it's minus 105. That's their spiel. They only take a 5% VIG, so it's advantageous to the Arbors and they welcome it.

That's huge. I was just wondering because I know that it's And so I'm like, all right, let me think about this because offshore is– I haven't, the only offshore I've ever used was steak way back when there wasn't a U.S. version and I was like, I... I don't know if I should trust it or whatnot. So that's why I wanted to ask him whether he used it or knows something about it directly.

Yeah, so all of the partners and our partners I've used except for Bet105, but I'm actually trying to get, like I don't even know if our referral even works right now, but I think it does, but like I've texted the guy actually today and sent him my email and we're gonna be talking more. So when I get more info on that, I'll definitely like let you know what the deal with that site is.

But with the offshores, they like, The ones that we have at least are relatively safe.

At least my bookie would pay out anybody.

And also Bet105 I would say is shady in the fact that they're offshore, but they're not shady.

Yeah, okay. All right, well, yeah, yeah. That was just a general question I had. I was just thinking about it. Named it there. Oh. Random question. I know that you have people take percentages. What's your stake, I guess, in dropout?

So like what percent ownership do I have?

Yeah, because I know people get paid out or you're paying out You said you had some sort of like someone was taking like 5% or something. I don't remember exactly what you said, but do you own 100% or is that like... Do you own 60, 70...

So like yes and yes and no to me owning 100% and then me owning 60%.

So we it's a single member LLC and I don't have any ownership structure other than one ownership unit.

So I am the only owner. But what I do is I give a percentage of the monthly revenue and technically is equivalent of an equity point, but I'm not doing equity at all. away from it because it's just what they're getting paid out and it's a flat. So basically like if I said you got 2% of the company, it would just be 2% of our subscription and monthly revenue. And so right now, let me actually flip to where this is in my page.

So we have... Uh.

Uh. Thank you. Let's see.

Actually, I have no idea where I put this. Yeah. Huh, where did I put my... Okay, so basically 20% of the company goes right into our bonus funds, which is the bonus funds is what we pay for our operating costs. And if it ever goes negative, I just cover it out of pocket.

But it's just like a recurring fund to say like, we have X amount of dollars set aside for marketing.

And then 10% I have set aside for three head staff members. Just one is my developer and then JP and Dante are the two other head staff. Dante might not be sticking around much longer. And then I have 10% that I have for my analysts.

So I give basically like each analyst gets around 1-2% of a rev share.

And then I also have a 5% that I set aside for a monthly bonus. conversion or if they invite someone to the server who converts, then they get points. And then those points add up to just like the equivalent of the 5% bonus. So like there's 10 points total, there's $100 in the bonus, and you get all 10 of the 10 points, you'll get all $100.

That's how that works.

Right now, So that would be 25% that is just like not owned by me. And then I'm thinking of adding in another 10 to 15% for business development.

Yeah, okay. Hell yeah. Yeah, I was just wondering what the splits look like. Because obviously, I know you've got to pay people out. You've got costs and whatnot. So I was just curious what... what that was looking like for him.

Yeah, I would say we keep our costs extremely low on the operating side. We have basically our Google Cloud subscription and then Some like chat GPT or cloud subscription or whatever, but like we don't pay for much a little bit of hosting So it's like sub 50 bucks a month, which is like negligible and then well now we're not making anything but It's really negligible and operating costs and then the analysts.

It's basically they just get paid a percentage of how much we make and It wasn't doing too well because like we weren't making too much and then they also just weren't converting and focusing on converting they were just focusing on sending pics So. The 5% bonus is one of the new things that I'm introducing to kind of just give everybody more incentive to actually not only send the pics but focus on the education and converting members onto the resources from the pics.

Yeah, so when you say converting, is that what bringing new members in or what's that?

So a conversion would just be if they were, for example, when you sign up to Onyx using our code, that would be a conversion.

If you were to sign up onto Bet105 using our code, that would be a conversion.

So just any of our partners.

Okay, gotcha. So if... If I were an analyst or someone sending out picks and I got people to sign up using dropouts, that would be a conversion. Yep.

And then there's one more thing. A lot of the... A lot of the, we're trying to personalize the Discord. So a lot of these features that I'm going to say right now aren't necessarily built yet. But in the future, right now, you may have seen our partner, Promobot. So, but basically you just tell us are your state and your age or age range. And we tell you what of our partners are available in your state.

And then the second caveat we have to that is the free access tickets where somebody just opens a ticket. So right now everything's manually manual, but we're eventually going to build it out so that when people claim a partner through the bot, then they'll have a ticket automatically created for them. give them seven free days when they verify the claim but it'll also just be automatically tracked one in our database and then two the person will just get the premium so that'll make it be a lot easier and then the second thing that's going to come out of that is every single person that i'll give you a custom invite link and we'll track it and so anybody who you invite to the server for example if i were the one to get them to sign up for onyx you would still get the points for version.

Okay. Gotcha. Because I invited them to the server.

Yep, exactly. Okay, gotcha. Every user gets basically double points.

So if you were the one that invited them and you were the one that converted them, then you could get all the points, like six.

Oh, okay. That's cool. I mean, okay. I know that part of the reason that we got on the call was because of the channel discussion. Where's your head at with that?

Yeah, so I guess like, um, just role wise. So, um, I'd be completely happy to either make you an analyst channel. The only thing that I would ask is that like, one is our current analyst and I'm not setting a good example of it, but one our current analysts are not really consistently Sending plays so the biggest thing if you were to get an analyst channel will just be the consistency behind it and then the other thing which is again This is just not as important because it's just like the way you send your pics is just like we'd want a little bit of like either research for people to like ask why And then you can provide more research to why, but like you have your model.

So like, however you wanted to share that would be fine. And then the only other thing is like that you provide a recap for daily.

Okay. Yeah. So daily recap of how the pigs performed and whatnot. Yeah. Okay. And that was it. You would what expect daily or pretty much daily.

Yeah, I just say daily. If you don't have anything for that specific day, that's completely fine. The only thing is if you miss four days in a row and then post one day and then skip three, then we'll have to look at things. But daily is like asterisk for daily whenever you have plays.

Okay, gotcha. Yeah, no, I mean, obviously I do this or I do my, my. thing pretty much every day. or close to it. So I don't think that would be an issue as far as that goes. I just want to know, like... With just truthfully blunt, how do you feel about that? right now. I know, obviously, I know I laid it out. Top of the station's not a is in a table talk right now. I know you obviously have the compensation issues.

I don't care about them. Where's your honest head at about making that? having that opportunity or me having that opportunity on the channel.

I'd be like I'd be completely happy to make you a channel and I guess like the only hesitancies that I have are if compensation were to be something then I would just need I'd be completely happy to like make the channel but I'd need a little bit of like thought behind where I came to before coming to that like compensation number but and then just like the next thing would be even if you didn't like for example want a compensation one thing that would wouldn't be Thank you.

You would be included regardless of if you wanted to comply is the staff bonus. So that is one thing that I'm going to be starting February is the staff bonus. So that would be something that you would be included in regardless.

Gross compensation. Yep. Yeah, yeah, no, I, um... Yeah, like I said, like I told you, like, I know you're repositioning right now. You've got to get this court all into where you want it to be. And I'm not worried about getting paid right now. I enjoy what I do. I do it for fun. I mean, obviously... I would never turn down money. I could never turn down money, but it's not my biggest worry at the moment.

I, you know, I, I appreciate your hustle. and what you're doing for the discord and whatnot so That's not an issue. I do want to obviously fulfill the role correctly. I don't want to give you half ass. I don't want to, you know, Even though I might not be getting paid at the moment, I don't want to give a lackluster job at what I'm doing. Make sure I do it correctly. It matters. actually helping you rather than just filling up a slot or filling up a channel in the Discord.

Yeah, and that really means a lot, and that would be really appreciated.

From the way that you talk about your model especially, I know that you wouldn't be putting in a half-assed job.

It would honestly just be an honor to have your model picks be sent in there. It would also just be a really big help to have you, especially with that mindset, just as we kind of get things rolling and try to get off the ground again.

Yeah, yeah, man. Obviously, I was there. I was there from pretty much the start. So I know where it can go, where it will be. And for me, I'm getting an outlet to put my stuff in, which is already what I was looking for. so I mean, it's, it's a win-win in that regard. Um, Awesome.

And with the routine that I mentioned is my calendar app is all invite you to just our organization, the Dropout Degens organization. So you'll have access to like all of our content. So it'll just be like you'll be able to see like what we're working towards goal wise and then just the projects we're working on and then also just what partners we have and the resources for it. And then.

Like, It'll just like, it'll be, you won't, I won't, you won't be just thrown into the deep end. And I'll have a couple other like documents that I'll be able to give you for like, actually like how, how they post and stuff.

Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I don't know what, I mean, I'll start tomorrow. If that's, if the channel's up tomorrow, I'll be there tomorrow. But whenever, whenever you are, whenever you get the channel up, um, I'll obviously, I'm sure you'll send me the guidelines and whatnot. And we'll keep chatting later on as well. Um, to figure it all out. But I mean, as soon as soon as it's up, I'm there. So just, you know, just...

Just holler at me. and whatnot, let me know the plan. I'll make sure to stay in line with you. And if, you know, we need a hot back on the call, whatever, Whatever.

I'll be there. Awesome.

That sounds good. Yeah, um, I don't have yeah, uh, what's time is it seven? Yeah Uh, I just have a call at 9 30 So I should be able to get your channel like up right after this. Um, and then also get you like a notify role Um and stuff so you'll be set with that um, the one thing that i'll say is that like we are just I mean you can see from the The members in the premium right now that there's like not that many people currently taking value Okay.

And also like I hate charging $50 a month for a subscription, but it's only to really validate our positioning and the value that we are doing. And then also just incentivize more conversions to the partnerships. But really I want to be giving away as much free premium as possible. So if you have any friends you want to invite or just people you know in Discord that bet and could use the server, I'd be more than happy to give anybody you invited just 30 free days.

Oh yeah, no, for sure. I mean, I definitely got some people that, that would be down. Um, I'm literally in a, uh, I'm in a Snapchat, uh, group chat with like 50 people from Tallahassee, uh, and go to FSU and whatnot. They, they, they're always talking about sports betting in there and whatnot. It's pretty much the whole point of the channel, but, um, yeah, I definitely got people that would probably join.

Um, hopefully, hopefully they would. Um, But, yeah, no, I'm more than happy to get people in there, premium or not. Like, I'm sure people will get in there just to talk about stuff. I mean, they talk to themselves in that group chat all day long about sports, soccer, NBA, basketball. whatever it is they're always talking but yeah I can definitely get people in there and then whenever obviously in the future when you want to start making that social media pivot um just let me know.

I got, I got resources and whatnot. I can, I, definitely help out on that end as well. Yeah, that sounds amazing.

And for, I'll give you a link as well for like anybody you invite to the server.

So we can just start to track them now. So just so like anybody who comes in will be like, I have some of them.

I have a post in the DraftKings Discord. So currently some people are like finding us through the DraftKings Discord because I'm hosting their server. So we can just, but I have an invite link that is just like a separate invite link for every single place. posted um so we know where everybody is coming in from um so i'll give you your own invite link for that as well um and then yeah it would be and then no pressure at all on like actually like getting any of them but for would love to have as many chatters in here because like yeah it's just so dead but um i'm also just reaching out to a bunch of other people as well right now to like kind of get them access into the server as well so hopefully there'll be more heads as well like take advantage of your place as well you Oh, yeah, no, for sure.

I mean, more people that see it. It's cool to me. I take pride in it for sure. Yeah, dude, one random question as well. Is your name actually Asia or is it?

My first name is Dax, D-A-X.

Okay, okay. There we go. I didn't know if your name was actually Asia or if that was just like, you know, just... Just the name of the discord or what not?

Nah, I just like to go on discord as AsiaD because I'm Asian and my first name starts with a D.

So, it kind of sounds funny.

This might sound insensitive, but I got a follow up. What kind of Asian are you?

I'm Vietnamese.

Okay, my girlfriend's Korean. That's why I was asking. Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. Oh, dude, tell me. Don't even get me started, man. Yeah, no, hell yeah. Okay, well, Dax, I appreciate the call, man. I appreciate you talking to me and whatnot. I mean, it's an honor to... you know, be a part of it and all. And I'm happy to see Happy to see the success that will be created. Happy to be part of the journey as well.

So, yeah.

Hell yeah, man. And I'll start working on all these things. And I'll send you a follow-up or two that I'll have you log into our website, and then I'll give you the staff role and stuff. But I'll just start getting worked on this right now and get you set up in the Discord.

And super appreciative of you, one, taking the time to talk today, and two, just also helping out.

And just really excited to just get into Discord active again and both seeing you back in the Discord. It makes me really happy as well.
