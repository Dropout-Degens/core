# Kayden Ongoing Expectations — As of January 29, 2026

---

## Role

Analyst

## Background

Kayden has been a member of the Dropout Degens Discord since 2023, essentially from the server's beginning. He's a college student at FSU and works at Outback. He has an NBA prediction model that he's been running independently — the night before this meeting, his model predicted two upsets that both hit, and he's up 17-18 units overall on his NBA strategy. He reached out to Dax asking for an analyst channel because he wanted an outlet to share his research with people who understand betting at his level.

Kayden also works with Layup (had a 45-minute conversation with them recently). His girlfriend is a social media influencer with 140,000 TikTok followers and is part of an esports team. Kayden runs his dad's business Instagram and has offered to help with DD's social media marketing when the time comes.

## Current Expectations

- **Analyst picks:** Post picks whenever he has plays. Daily posting is expected when he has plays. Missing one day is fine; missing four days in a row, posting once, then skipping three is not acceptable. The focus is on consistency.

- **Daily recaps:** For every day picks are sent, post a recap of how they performed before the next day's picks go out.

- **Research framing:** Share the reasoning behind picks — what the model showed, what factors informed the pick, why there's value. The goal is education-first: members should be able to understand how to replicate the research or at least ask questions about it.

- **Community engagement:** Be active in the Discord. Kayden mentioned he used to check the server throughout the day in 2023 to see what people were discussing. That kind of engagement is valuable.

- **Member recruitment:** Invite people to the server using his tracked invite link. Kayden has a Snapchat group chat with ~50 FSU students who talk about sports betting. Anyone he invites can get 30 free days of premium.

- **Social media (future):** Help with social media marketing once the community is more active (target: 20 daily active members chatting). Not an immediate expectation.

## Compensation

- **Base:** Not set yet. Kayden explicitly said he doesn't care about compensation right now and wants to help the Discord succeed. If compensation becomes relevant, Dax will need to determine a percentage.

- **Staff bonus:** Kayden is automatically included in the 5% monthly bonus pool regardless of whether he takes a base percentage. He earns points for:
  - Conversions: Getting members to sign up for DD partners using DD's code
  - Invites: Members who join through his tracked invite link and later convert

- **Double points:** If Kayden both invites a member and converts them, he gets points for both actions.

## Unique Considerations

- Kayden has a working NBA model that has been performing well (17-18 units up, two upset predictions hit the night before). This is a real edge he's bringing to the Discord.
- He's motivated by wanting an outlet for his research, not by money. He stated he won't give a half-assed effort even without immediate compensation.
- He's ready to start immediately — as soon as the channel is up, he'll post.
- He has social media knowledge through his girlfriend and his work on his dad's business Instagram. This is a future resource for DD's marketing.
- He asked about Bet105 because he's worried about getting limited by sportsbooks if his model keeps winning. He's thinking ahead about offshore options.
