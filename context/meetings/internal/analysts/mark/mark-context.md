# Mark — Current Context

**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026
**Role:** Analyst
**Status:** Active

---

## Background

Mark previously worked with Dropout Degens approximately 1.5 years ago but left because he was spending more time on his own server than on DD. He's a junior at a university in California. He runs his own sports betting Discord server (currently dead).

He already practices line shopping and research-based betting personally using OddsJam, the Novig odds calculator, and Kelly criterion for bet sizing. He typically plays 2-leg EV parlays. He has experience with offshore sportsbooks, which is knowledge most members and staff don't have. He purchased the Platinum version of Algezine for DFS and offshore books and canceled his DGF subscription due to overlap.

## Current Role & Expectations

**Analyst** — education-focused picks, member engagement, conversion driver

- **Analyst picks:** Post picks as schedule allows. Focus is on education and transparency — explain the reasoning and tools behind each pick.
- **Betting education:** Answer member questions directly (especially newer bettors). Post educational content at his discretion in betting channels.
- **Screenshots:** Send screenshots of bets and apps whenever possible. Dollar amounts optional. Lean into DFS app screenshots as a strength.
- **Seed engagement:** Vote on daily poll. React in daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, and community picks channels.
- **Channel activity:** Be active in assigned channels. Help retain members that Dax brings back.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 per month required. Submit proof: screenshot of signup + tag person in partner attribution channel.
- **Welcome tickets:** Help answer unanswered tickets from new server joins when available.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep 2026 bet tracking spreadsheet up to date (Dax to send).
- **Layup referrals:** Assist with Layup referrals when possible ($50 gift card per referral).

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue (requires 5 conversions/month)
- **Projected February revenue base:** At least $1,000
- **Subscription price pivot:** $50/month starting early March
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points (1 point per partner signup, 3 points per new premium member through invite link)

## Access & Setup

- [x] Analyst channel created
- [x] Tracked invite link set up
- [x] Staff role assigned
- [ ] Bet tracking spreadsheet sent (2026 updated version)
- [ ] Analyst documentation with conversion system details sent

## Unique Considerations

- **California location:** Limits personal access to most DD partners. Does not affect ability to help members in other states.
- **DFS and offshore access:** Underdog, PrizePicks, offshore books, Platinum Algezine. Advantage for screenshot content.
- **OddsJam workflow:** Uses Novig + Kelly criterion. Dax plans to build these as Discord bots based on Mark's walkthrough.
- **Layup connection:** Referred Huddy for a Layup call (scheduled Monday at 4 PM). Potential for more referrals.
- **Own server:** Has a small member base that could be an acquisition source for DD.
