# Mark — Current Context

**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026
**Role:** Analyst
**Status:** Active — onboarded, channel to be created

---

## Background

Mark previously worked with Dropout Degens approximately 1.5 years ago but left because he was spending more time on his own server than on DD. He's a junior at a university in California, currently on winter break back home in LA. He runs his own sports betting Discord server (currently dead).

He already practices line shopping and research-based betting personally, so the education-first approach is a natural fit for him. He has experience with offshore sportsbooks, which is knowledge most members and staff don't have.

## Current Role & Expectations

**Analyst** — education-focused picks

- **Analyst picks:** Daily posting not mandatory — every other day or as schedule allows. Focus is on education and transparency, not volume.
- **Daily recaps:** For every day picks are sent, post a recap before the next day's picks.
- **Education-first framing:** Reference tools and research behind picks. Explain the "why" — which tools were used, what trends informed the pick, why the line has value.
- **Seed engagement:** Vote on daily poll. React in daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, and community picks channels.
- **Channel activity:** Be active in 5 assigned channels — general chat, members chat, 1-2 betting floor channels, the lab or cheat sheets/bot places.
- **Conversions:** Submit screenshots in partner attribution channel (screenshot + partner name).
- **Member recruitment:** Check in with members from his own server about joining DD. Anyone who joins through his tracked invite link and creates a ticket gets 7 free days premium.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly revenue (start date TBD — may be January or February)
- **Growth path:** Percentage can increase based on member acquisition and conversion performance
- **Bonus pool:** 5% of monthly profit distributed proportionally based on conversion points. Targeting February launch.

## Access & Setup

- [ ] Analyst channel created
- [ ] Tracked invite link set up
- [ ] Staff role assigned

## Unique Considerations

- **California location:** Limits his personal access to most DD partners. Does not affect his ability to help members in other states.
- **Offshore experience:** Has knowledge most members and staff don't have.
- **Own server:** Has a small member base that could be an acquisition source for DD. Dax offered 7 free days premium for anyone Mark brings over.

## Growth Tactics Discussed

Mark suggested some guerrilla marketing ideas:
- Using alts or bots to forward EV alerts into other Discord servers (Dax is cautious about optics)
- DraftKings server boosting ($3 to boost, staff with DD tag visible acts as passive marketing)
