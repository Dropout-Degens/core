# Mark 1:1 Summary — January 3, 2026

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Mark (Analyst)
**Purpose:** Re-recruitment pitch, education-first pivot overview, role assignment, onboarding

---

## Background

Mark previously worked with Dropout Degens approximately 1.5 years ago but left because he was spending more time on his own server than on DD. He is a junior at a university in California, currently on winter break back home in LA. He also runs his own (currently dead) sports betting Discord server.

## Education-First Pivot

Dax walked Mark through the company's evolution across three stages:
- **Year 1:** Grew from 0 to ~3,000 members organically through the Fliff server
- **Year 2:** Scaled partnerships but did not scale conversions to match
- **Year 3:** Pivoting to education-first positioning — teaching members how to research and validate picks using integrated tools rather than just providing picks to follow blindly

Dax shared the new tagline: "Empowering sports bettors with access to the resources and knowledge that they need to define and take advantage of profitable markets right inside our Discord."

The partnership framing is shifting from "use our code for X bonus" to "add this sportsbook to your arsenal for line shopping and arbitrage." Mark noted this aligns with what he already does personally, making the transition easy for him.

## EV Tools

Dax showed Mark the EV alert system:
- Powered by OddsJam and Daily Grind Fantasy partnership data
- Approximately 2,000+ alerts per day, thousands of data points
- Developing proprietary filters and confidence scoring (80-90% confidence levels)
- EV filters are a key justification for the price increase to $50/month

## Partner Promo Bot

Dax demoed the partner promo bot. Mark is in California, which has limited partner availability (the California view was broken). Mark mentioned he has experience with offshore sportsbooks, which gives him knowledge most members don't have. Dax clarified the bot isn't fully finished — completion is targeted for mid-January.

## Revenue and Growth Model

- Current LTV per customer: approximately $1,500 across all partnership conversions
- Projected LTV after Dax turns 21 (February): $2,000-$2,500 with major sportsbook partnerships (FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM, etc.)
- Current partnerships: 25, projected to grow to 35-40 by February
- Current subscription pricing: $15/month, increasing to $50/month
- Previous paid acquisition cost: $0.25-$1.00 per user; willing to pay up to $5 per user once conversion funnel is validated
- At $50 CPA per partner conversion, only need a small conversion rate to be profitable
- Strategy: give free premium generously now (at $15/month it doesn't matter), lock in value at $50/month later

## Growth Tactics Discussed

- **Guerrilla marketing:** Forwarding EV alerts with DD referral links into other Discord servers. Dax already got banned from one large server for this. Mark suggested using alts or bots, but Dax is cautious about the optics.
- **DraftKings server boosting:** Boosting DD in the DraftKings Discord so the server shows up in the booster list. $3 to boost. Staff with the DD tag visible in other servers acts as passive marketing.
- **Community acquisition:** Dax is in talks with someone who has ~300 premium members. Negotiation is difficult given DD's current inactive state. Would come with analysts.
- **Mark's server:** Dax asked if Mark could bring active members over from his own server. Mark said it's mostly dead but will check in with a few people.
- **Karma system:** Exists but underutilized. Plan to make it more of a feature to encourage engagement.

## Demographic Challenge

Dax explained why the community declined: most users came from the Fliff server. Half had specific Fliff questions (withdrawals, features) and left once answered. The other half were younger users who aged into college and dropped off Discord. This makes re-engagement of the existing base unreliable — new acquisition is the focus.

## Mark's Role

Mark is coming on as an **analyst**. Key expectations:
- Daily picks are not mandatory — every other day is acceptable
- Focus is less on posting picks and more on educating members and driving conversions
- Reference tools and research behind picks (Props Cache, Outlier, EV data)
- Help members validate and research their own picks
- Post daily recaps for every day picks are sent (before the next day's picks go out)
- Seed reactions and vote on daily polls
- Be active in 5 assigned channels (general chat, members chat, 1-2 betting floor channels, the lab or cheat sheets/bot places)
- Submit conversion screenshots in the partner attribution channel

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly revenue (may not be active until February; January is uncertain)
- **Growth opportunity:** Percentage can increase based on bringing in and converting members via a tracked invite link
- **Bonus pool:** 5% of monthly profit allocated to a conversion bonus pool. Staff earn points per conversion and receive a proportional share of the pool. Likely not ready until February.
- Conversions tracked via partner attribution channel — screenshot of person + partner name, bot tallies at end of month

## Mark's Server

Mark runs his own Discord server (also dead). Dax asked if Mark would be willing to merge it. Dax said he wouldn't force it. Mark said he'd check in with a few of his members about joining DD. Offer of 7 free days of premium for anyone from Mark's server who joins and creates a ticket.

## Key Decisions

- Mark assigned as analyst
- Tracked invite link to be set up for Mark
- Analyst channel to be created for Mark
- Daily picks not mandatory; education and conversion focus
- 2% base compensation, bonus pool targeting February launch
- Free premium (7 days) offered for any members Mark brings from his server
- Discord content updates coming by Sunday
