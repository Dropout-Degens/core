# Business Context — As of January 3, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is in the final stages of its education-first pivot. Most Discord content has been updated to reflect the new positioning, with remaining updates scheduled to be complete by Sunday (January 5th). The community is currently inactive — Dax described it as being in a "dead space" while the foundation is rebuilt. The company previously acquired a couple of other Discord servers, but those communities fizzled out after 6-12 months.

## Team

- Dax (CEO) — sole operator, balancing full-time job and school. Junior year.
- JP — mod, present daily but limited capacity
- Dante — analyst, posting approximately once a week
- Mark — being re-recruited as analyst on this call. Previously on the team ~1.5 years ago. Junior at a California university.
- Dax is actively looking to bring on additional analysts and is in talks to acquire a community (~300 premium members) that would come with analysts.
- Most of the original staff have been removed or gone inactive.

## Revenue

- Subscription pricing: $15/month, with a planned increase to $50/month once EV filters, partner promo bot, and educational content are fully delivered
- Partnership CPA: approximately $50 per app signup using DD's code (DFS apps and social sportsbooks)
- Current LTV per customer: approximately $1,500 across all available partnership conversions
- Projected LTV after Dax turns 21 (February): $2,000-$2,500, as major sportsbook partnerships (FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM) become available
- Current partnerships: 25, projected to grow to 35-40 by February
- Previous paid acquisition cost: $0.25-$1.00 per user. Willing to pay up to $5 per user once conversion funnel is proven.
- Dax is giving away free premium generously at $15/month since the price increase to $50 is imminent — current giveaways have minimal revenue impact
- Revenue is minimal right now. The focus is on building the product and conversion infrastructure, not on immediate revenue.

## Product State

- EV alert system is live but filters are not yet released. Powered by OddsJam and Daily Grind Fantasy data. Approximately 2,000+ alerts per day. Developing proprietary confidence scoring and filters (targeting 80-90% confidence levels).
- Partner promo bot exists but is not finished. California availability is broken. Mid-January completion target.
- Integrated tools: Props Cache, Outlier, OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy. Had Optimal but it's currently uncertain.
- Welcome ticket system and premium walkthrough tickets are planned but not yet fully built.
- Karma system exists but is underutilized. Plan to make it more prominent for engagement.
- Discord still needs cleaning — some channels lack clear purpose. Update scheduled by Sunday.

## Growth Strategy

- Guerrilla marketing: forwarding EV alerts with DD referral links into other Discord servers (already got banned from one large server for this)
- DraftKings server boosting: $3 to boost, staff show up in booster list with DD tag visible
- Community acquisition: in talks with a server owner who has ~300 premium members
- Mark's own server as a potential member source
- Paid acquisition (Meta ads at $1-5/user) planned once conversion funnel is validated
- Tracking: all invite links are now tracked through the Dropout Degens bot via Supabase. Goal is to understand which acquisition channels produce the highest-converting members.

## Demographic Challenge

The existing member base largely came from the Fliff server. Many of those users either had one-off questions about Fliff (and left once answered) or were younger kids who have since aged into college and dropped off Discord. This makes re-engaging the existing 8,000 members unreliable. The strategic focus is on new acquisition rather than re-engagement of old members.

## Strategic Direction

The education pivot is nearly complete. Next priorities are:
1. Release EV filters and finish the partner promo bot
2. Build out retention and conversion features (welcome tickets, premium walkthrough tickets, automated messaging)
3. Increase pricing to $50/month
4. Validate the conversion funnel with organic and guerrilla traffic
5. Scale through paid acquisition once unit economics are proven
6. Acquire another community for quick member base growth
