# Mark Ongoing Expectations — As of January 3, 2026

---

## Role

Analyst

## Background

Mark previously worked with DD about 1.5 years ago but left because he was spending more time on his own server. He runs his own (currently inactive) sports betting Discord. He is a junior in college in California, currently on winter break. He already practices line shopping and research-based betting personally, so the education-first approach is a natural fit.

## Current Expectations

- **Analyst picks:** Post picks when available. Daily posting is not mandatory — every other day or as schedule allows is acceptable. The focus is less on volume of picks and more on the education and transparency behind them.
- **Daily recaps:** For every day picks are sent, post a recap before the next day's picks go out.
- **Education-first framing:** Reference tools and research behind picks. Explain the "why" — which tools were used, what trends informed the pick, why this line has value. The goal is to help members learn to validate and research their own picks.
- **Seed engagement:** Vote on the daily poll. React in daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, and community picks channels.
- **Channel activity:** Be active in 5 assigned channels — general chat, members chat, 1-2 betting floor channels, and the lab or cheat sheets/bot places.
- **Conversions:** Help convert members onto partnerships through education and natural recommendation. Submit screenshots in the partner attribution channel (screenshot + partner name).
- **Member recruitment:** Check in with members from his own server about joining DD. Anyone who joins through Mark's tracked invite link and creates a ticket gets 7 free days of premium.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly revenue (start date TBD — may be January or February)
- **Growth path:** Percentage can increase based on member acquisition and conversion performance
- **Bonus pool:** 5% of monthly profit distributed proportionally based on conversion points earned. Targeting February launch.

## Unique Considerations

- Mark is in California, which limits his personal access to most DD partners. This does not affect his ability to help members in other states find and use their available partnerships.
- Mark has offshore sportsbook experience, which is knowledge most members and staff don't have.
- Mark has his own server with a small member base — potential acquisition source for DD.
