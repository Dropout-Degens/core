Hey Mark, how's it going? Hello? Yo. How are you?

I'm chilling bro, it's been a minute right?

Yeah, it's been a while. It's been like probably over a year and a half. Hey, what's up? How you been, bro? I've been doing good. I'm in my junior year now. Are you senior? Yeah, me too.

No, me too. Where are you at again?

California, right?

Yeah.

Nice, nice. How is that treating you?

it's good I'm back at vacation right now back home in LA Funny enough, I literally am watching the Cal game right now. Playing order damn are they winning? We're down two with 20 20 seconds left. Are you guys any good? Yeah, bro. We were 12-1 and we lost to Louisville. We lost to Louisville and... We were favored for this game, but... I mean... Yeah, we're losing, so. Damn. We were receiving votes, though, man.

But yeah, how's DD been?

uh it's been slow but we've been like growing super huge when it comes to our partnerships so like like our community's been kind of like dead um like i acquired like a couple other discords but like they just quit like after uh like six months to a year so like their communities just fizzled out so i've been like i don't really care as much because we've been focusing on like focusing on growing are just like product value and how much like we make from our conversions so like from all the apps that we can convert a user onto we can generate up to like 1500 bucks um from our partnerships um and then we've also got like a bunch of integrations with um we've got props cash outlier um oddstram daily grind fantasy we had um optimal we might get it back at one point but it's in the air right now but um we have all these integrations our focus to be more of a like education first like this is how you like not only have profitable picks, but this is the research behind them and this is like the tools we use to actually research the picks and kind of that like approach when it comes to just like Be whole I guess like when it comes to the whole space, like all the discords, their goal is to just give their members profitable picks.

And that's like what their users pay for. But like if we just pivot our like mission to be more like education focused, then our mission is to educate younger sports bettors to like, I changed our tag like real recently, like empowering sports bettors with access to the resources and knowledge that they need to define their and take advantage of profitable markets right inside our Discord. So when it comes to sports betting communities, we can just differentiate ourselves as being not only the space like...

to find profitable picks, but actually the the place where you find those strategies, those tools, and the resources, and actually utilize that knowledge to place those picks.

Yeah, that makes it okay. I feel you. Yeah, okay.

So like, we're just gonna like pivot, we're kind of pivoting our like framework around that. And we're also when I turn 21, we're just gonna have a ton more partnerships because we're gonna have all the legal apps. So it's like, FanDuel, DraftKings, MG, like so many. Like we have 25 right now, but we'll probably have closer to like 35, 40 come February. And our LTV, I'm projecting it to be about 2,000 to 2,500.

So like what we just need to focus on is like actually giving our members access to the value and helping them take advantage of all these bonuses and like signup offers and then also the tools and resources that we use.

Not really that much, but also like...

Use the apps as well. And I guess like the positioning we're trying to take with it is more of like not just sign up and use our like, oh, you can get X in bonus bets. You can get X with using the dropouts code. It's going to be more like you should add this to your arsenal so you can line shop or arbitrage or say, oh, I find more value because like it's minus 120 here versus minus 105 on this other book.

and actually make more valuable bets over time.

Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I already do that on my own, so I think... It'd be... it wouldn't be that different from what I'm already doing.

Yeah, it's not really like the analysts will have the channels and then like we'll have all the discord and it'll be like the community part. But like the only thing that we're just like focusing on is like, how can we bring our members value and then also like how can we help convert them through our partnership funnel? Okay, alright, alright. I guess like... When it comes to like Would you be interested in coming back onto the team for something like that?

Yeah, like I mentioned, I mean, it's like just personally and like what I would do on my server, that's similar to what I do already. So I think it wouldn't like be like a big transition for me. I think I'd be able to. Jump in, be useful.

Yeah, the biggest way I would say is applying what it is to be an analyst and trying to give that value and say, oh, this is just like give that transparency behind it and say, oh, yeah, I use this tool to find that or I use this. And that'll help us not only convert, but also give our members the value to become like be able to validate and research their own picks. And like, for example, if you send them something out, they actually have the props cache.

Let me just check his last five real quick to make sure like Poro knows what he's talking about or like any other tool. And that's kind of like the goal that we're trying to push our members towards.

Uh, okay. Alright, alright. Uh... How long has it been since you guys transitioned? So it's like this.

So we've been, I guess like... I'll... section our growth into about three stages like in in year one we just grew a lot like from our member base um like we just grew like from one to like i think it was like 3 000 members um just from like the flip server and our like organic um growth um and like in year two that helped us that organic growth just helped us scale our partnerships and in year two we kind of just like focused on all of these partnerships um and like in year three and then this is another I didn't really mention as much, but we get, because of our partnership with Odd Jam and Daily Grand Fantasy, we have so much of their betting data.

So, like, basically, they tell us what to bet. And we, like, we were around when we had our EV. Um Well, basically we have, let me forward this to you. We have a ton of these. We get about three every five minutes, I think. So it's like... We did it. thousands a day. So like what we're trying to do or what we're doing right now is We're developing filters and algorithms where we put our own score on top of this and say, oh, this is going to be– we're 80% confident with this or 90% confident with this and stuff like that.

But what we– after– That were kind of like... Um... I know, I know, I just saw it.

Literally right now, you said it, I literally just saw it.

Dude.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But... What we're really focusing on now is because we have integrations, we're going to also just increase our pricing to $50 a month. We're 15 right now. So we're just gonna utilize basically these are all the things that we have to offer and then through the premium And so the outlier insights will be a big thing, props, cash, spot, and then our EV will be a big push for us for why we are actually transitioning to $50, along with just the analyst aspect.

But once we transition to then, we're going to have filters for our EV as well. And it's kind of just focus on our marketing, because then this is probably like for year four. Roadmaps in the future for like what we're gonna focus on is now that we know our users will be over us after February for example $2,500 we need to figure out what channels that the users come from that the most and then we're gonna focus on those channels So if that makes sense, like we're basically gonna implement a lot of tracking and let me actually tag you in this channel real quick This kind of sucks for you because you're in California.

Yeah. So you have nothing. But you could theoretically just make your state anything and check out how that works. But we are going to focus on understanding where our users come from, like from the invite links. And then also just like... how much they're converting to get a good price point down because we previously paid about 25 cents like a dollar per user and if we can pay like up to five bucks for people that don't convert on one partner and then our partners average about 50 bucks a pop for one so that we'll be in a really good boat if we can just like focus on these channels and start getting a good return on ad spend that way and that's going to be in like year three or i guess like more year four growth Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

Wait, so in this free access, we... Do I click the... Or is this you just wanted me to see or am I supposed to or do you want me to take it?

Yeah, you can just click the promo. bot, the click here to get started. and then it'll have you pick your jurisdiction United States, you'll have to scroll and find California. And then Let me actually make mine California real quick to see what you have. I don't think it's like gonna be anything.

Okay, I see it, I see it.

Okay, yeah, California is definitely broken, so you cannot claim any of these, probably, but...

Yesterday? I've already, like, not even just since yesterday, but even for some time before, I've used offshore sportsbooks. So I think it's something that I could... you know, I have more knowledge on than most people.

Yeah. And even like, it doesn't matter if you aren't able to use your partners. The biggest thing would just be like, oh, these are the helping our users find it. So like people who are in like, for example, Texas, they can be like, oh, this is what I have available. And this will be, I guess this, not be live right now. I have it out just so I can show people, but it's definitely not finished. We still have to finish it up.

But that's roadmap for middle of January, I believe. I can also share that document real quick.

Yeah, please.

Uh, I could just... Uh, let me... Good. this real quick. But basically just to review our mission and vision, like focusing on the education aspect by providing them access and teaching them how to use the tools. And we want to differentiate ourselves because of that education aspect. And then it's like we want to just each like. Our end goal for you is that each one could theoretically start their own sports betting community as an analyst or like start their own thing and know what they're doing and just like Kind of like...

If we take more of the course selling approach, we could probably be more while still just focusing on like the community aspect, if that makes sense, then we can, position that way and that Just focusing on not only that you get the bonus, that you'll also get another sportsbook to line shop, and the more the merrier in your arsenal. And then for our roadmap, so basically the education pivot that you asked about, we've basically about done that.

We just have to release our filters for FluffyV. And then we've done that. But basically most of our content is updated in the Discord. Well, if it's not right now, it will be by Sunday. But then we're going to be focusing on our retention and conversions. So basically this is just a lot of bots and developments. So basically every new user who joins the server will be updated. a welcome ticket and then it will just be able to be like hey this is what will automate the messages and everything but we'll we'll have the mods taking care of it to just make the experience more personalized and then we'll also have a lot more tickets for when people actually start their premium to say hey if you need anything this is this is personalized experience how we can help you out and we're also just on our conversions.

For example, in these messages, let me-Pull this up Um... And these messages right here. All of these are going to be our referral links. So this will be a good way for us to increase our conversions. And then also what we're going to be doing is we're adding our Dropout Degens link right below this. And this will allow us to forward these in other servers. So people will just be able to just see this and then also come to Dropout Degens because of this and anything we forward it to.

So I have a list of servers that we're going to be like kind of guerrilla marketing our way through.

Okay. I like that. I like, obviously I like that.

Okay. It's like, I don't really know how well it'll go. And I think I might get banned from a bunch. Like I already got banned from r slash sports book, like, or like this big ass sports server for sending these. Like that's bullshit. I didn't even do anything but send these.

I will, I will definitely say, um, I don't know. like the logistics on it, but I know people use alts and I know definitely people use bots to send it. So... I mean, I don't know if the bots is something you'd want to take, like... Go on that route or obviously just isn't all because you don't you don't want that to happen on like other servers Yeah, but I'm also like I also don't want to like be like Oh yeah, the server is botting.

But we'll see. We'll have to see the approach. I think the best way to go about it would be like, oh, I'm placing this because of the search. And hopefully don't get banned. And they can, hopefully.

Like now Sean will be kind of like, I'm using this server, but like, you know.

I'm not saying join it, but at the same time, you know.

At the same time, also like, if you click on, or if you look on my name in the, in the thing like anytime anybody with the DJ tag oh yeah it's super good um Like just... Little marketing here and then another thing we're gonna do is in drafting. I'm gonna boost the server Because server boosters show up here So I just got to fix my bio up real quick and then boost boost myself up here and then maybe people will see it.

Because, like, honestly, like, people look at this and there's a lot of people on DraftKings.

I would do... Put an exclamation point in front of your name. No way. I'm already at A. Yeah, but I mean, yeah, okay.

Fair enough.

But like... I wish somebody was boosting that was online, but the boosts do show up here. I just don't know if they get a click rate, so... I mean, it's, like, $3 to boost a server, so fuck it. I'll boost DraftKings if people click on my bio. But, like, basically... We're gonna also just... I look to acquire a community. I'm talking to somebody right now that has about 300 premium members that we're looking to possibly acquire, but it's kind of hard to negotiate this when we don't have that much going on, except for the value that we have future.

But basically, we're just focusing on all of the future value that we can bring. The best way that I'll say it is like, It doesn't matter in this like month or previous few months where we weren't making as much if we can focus on making more from each user then it won't really matter about these months where we weren't able to make as much per user so like Basically focusing on just getting all these ready when it comes to the conversion and retention.

And then we have like, I don't know if you're around for this, but we have the Karma feature as well, which... We don't like do much with it right now, but we're gonna try to make it feature because it's not in all the discords and it'll encourage engagement um but we're doing a lot with reactions right now we're trying to seed reactions in a couple of channels um but basically this will allow us to just once we got everything drilled down in the discord and have an active community and are able to get the max value from users we're just going to focus on our marketing um and growth and we're just going to say i will pay like up to five bucks per user and for every user do our best we can to convert as many partners as we can and we're just going to keep reinvesting and finding the ones that bring the best converting users.

Okay, alright. That sounds good, yeah.

Yeah, so basically it's we're kind of like in a dead space until one I can acquire a new community and then to restart our community re-engagement campaign. But it's. If you would be willing, like, it would be probably, if you'd want the analyst role, we would have that for you.

Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, no, yeah. I'm on board.

Awesome. I guess like so Do you have any questions? And then like capacity wise, like how active do you think you could be in the discord?

I think I'm having a similar problem with you, like a master of reverse. Like it's kind of dead just because it is harder to get, um, active members so I mean I would it was it won't be an issue like it was when I had to leave for the first time where I was spending a lot more time on my server than on Dropout. So I think I think I'd be... Activity-wise, I don't think it'd be an issue. The only question I have is, like, right now, let's say, like...

What could I do right now? That makes sense.

Yeah, so I'm gonna set you up with an analyst channel and then So basically just if you had, and then one thing I'll say is like, yeah, definitely like, um, also with the way we're focusing, I don't think like the pics aspect, if daily pics, if you don't think you can do daily pics or if you're just doing every other day, like it's not as big of a deal. We're going to try to focus more on like. actually the Allier Insights and the EV and the Props Cash and everything that we have from our partners as well as our analyst team.

And then I'm also trying to get a couple more guys on the team just to... spread it out pretty well and then if I do a community acquisition it will come with a bunch of analysts so but basically like it's not that big of a deal it's more of the it's less of the posting it's more of the educating and converting Okay, alright.

And are you converting, obviously, to have them sign up to these partners?

Yep, with our dropouts code. Okay, alright.

Alright, I like that, I like that.

But like, and then, so, do you still want to keep your, like, and I won't make you, um... If you don't want to, if you don't want to move your server over, I won't make you, but do you have any members that you think would be active that you can bring to dropout degens?

I can check in. I can check in with a couple people. Just let them know that like, you know, I'm also on this server as well if you guys want to join. But, uh...

uh like i said it's kind of it's kind of dead but i i will check in yeah yeah sounds good the problem with like the with the being dead is our demographic that we pulled in is all so i was just doing a lot of research on our users and our demographics and like basically a lot of the users that we came in were from the flip-flops and that either means that one they were like they had a specific question about fliff like did this work how can i withdraw how do i get to 50 dollars etc etc and like once that specific question was answered it's very hard to like re-obtain that customer base and then the other half of them were just like younger kids using fliff so they're college students now and like they just kind of dropped off and depreciated on discord so like that's kind of where a lot of our community issues come from and then like did um since they're since the guys left and just aren't here anymore it's like most of the community members also um are not as active so Yeah, no, I feel you.

It happens to me too. It happened. Um to me to some extent to what you're talking about, Pia. but no yeah it makes sense um Awesome. Like I said, I like the idea, I like the plan.

So make some money. Yeah. Awesome. And then payment wise, I'm still figuring out if like I'm going to have everybody on for January. I want to, but I'm still figuring out like a couple percentages. So basically for analysts, I'll be able to base you at just 2% if that's okay. And then I would be 100% willing to grow your percentage, but we would have to just set you up with like an invite link and like you'd have to just bring members.

converting up members that actually like contribute to the growth of the server, if that makes sense. Basically, I'll set you up with the 2% base and then I'm also going to get and this is where I don't know if I'm gonna have this ready by January or not, but I want to give everybody I'm gonna have like a 5% cut pool of the monthly profit that goes to just anybody who gets a conversion or earn either like a point or maybe like two points depending on our partners, but basically you'll receive um a percentage of the 5% allotment, like, that is equivalent of the points you made up.

So, basically, if it's, like, $100, that 5% equals $100 in extra bonuses, um, and you had, like, for example, like, uh, there were 100 points as well, and you had 77 points, then you would get 77 out of $100, um, out of that bonus, um, for example. Um, and so that's, I don't know if that'll be in by January, um, but I'm getting documents together, and, uh, I want it, it'll definitely be in by starting February.

Thank you.

Alright, sun's up, sun's up.

Um, but basically for now, and then like I do have, um, let me just check what, um, So the only things that I would be asking for is I'll get you that channel I'll have you grab your staff role and if you could grab the DJ and tag that would be great And then I'll give you a back tracking spreadsheet if you want to use it You don't have to if you don't want to but the thing we do need is just please make sure to do a daily Recap for every single day you send pics I'm just trying to send that recap before you send out the next day's pics and then we have a couple of channels that we're trying to just seed some community interaction with.

So it would be helpful if you just added some extra reactions and then voted on our daily poll in a couple of channels. And then there's like, since we have so many channels and they're all inactive right now, I'll give you a list of five different channels that we're just like, these are the best ones that you could be active in. If that sounds good.

All right. Um... We'll just find it. Hold on. Alright, there you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, alright. And then the The last thing is, like... or any of your members Um, How do you want to like, would you want to give them free premium? For anybody like in your server that would come over to ours Um...

Yeah, sure. I mean, if that's simple or easy for you, then yeah.

Uh, yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, the goal for me right now, since, and also, I don't, I will give as much free premium right now as possible, um, because we're currently at $15 a month, and I don't really care, uh, because we're gonna be at $50 a month by February, um, so I don't really care about giving out free premium right now, um, so... like for anybody who you I guess like let's just do seven free days to start and then if they convert on our partner we can just give them more that way but just have them join the server and then create a ticket in that in this channel I can give you a link to the message Um...

But just and then if they just say they're from your server, I'll I'll give you Actually, I'll give you an invite link real quick. Let me do that real quick. So this should be the message link for... Um... this and then Anybody you invite to this server, if you could invite them from This this invite link Oh shit. That did not copy. One second. And then this will just allow me to start tracking things for you.

And so now like anybody who joins will know which how many partners they go through etc. And then So basically If you could vote on the Daily Poll, that's in this channel. And then-We are looking for reactions in And then I'll send you a message like, Um. like this but Basically, I'll give you a bet tracking spreadsheet and then put on the daily poll and then React to the daily free picks and the partner promos and then greened out or community picks so just try to React in this channel I'm seeing reactions but just like our goal with these is one to increase like the members using their karma and earning car so we can do more with it and then to just like our reaction is For this are from this so the more people that see that they found value from this Hopefully the higher conversion rates we can get on some of these things and then the five channels that we're trying to get active are just like general chat members chat and then all you pick which like one or two of these Um...

just the bedding floor channels just one or two of these try and get active or chat where you can in and then just either the lab or if you had to find any cheat sheets or find the bot place helpful being active in any of these channels right now would be great Alright, alright. I'll send you a message, by the way, with that.

Yeah, I was about to say, I saw that message.

I would forward it to you, but it doesn't copy the references, so I have to rewrite it. I'm doing that right now but um... of the And then, I guess, like, any questions so far on anything? Or...

No, it makes sense to me.

And then I guess like, do you have any thoughts or ideas on like, We're just trying to, one, we're trying to get active right now, and then two, we're trying to get, like, just scale members and... Preferably cheaply. So like through Discord or like... I was trying real sports as an acquisition channel for a little while. It didn't work the best ever, but it was worth a shot. They've got a very good attractive audience for us.

But I guess like, do you have any thoughts on anything?

No, not right now. I think if I have anything I'll definitely let you know. Um, I would say,What, actually let me check before. Yeah, no, I think I told you, you probably don't remember, but something, When I was here the first time was I think cleaning the Discord was something that was needed a lot and he definitely did that.

So, yeah, it definitely needs a lot of cleaning still. I'm trying to, all the channels will have their own purpose or they will get removed. And so there will be an update again by Sunday. But we also do kind of like have a lot of channels. So that's kind of also a problem and a good thing, not necessarily, but... I guess the thing with the more channels is hopefully it helps us look more established and also helps us find, segment our resources a little more.

Okay. All right. But anything else? Any last... Thoughts? Not... No, I think...

No, you really covered it all, basically.

Awesome. I guess, like, I'll send you... I have an AI meeting that's going on right now, so I'll send a follow-up from that. And then I'll send you the rest of the messages. I'm typing those right now. And then... Ch-ch-ch. I will, yeah, I'll let you know about the 2% for if it'll be in January. But for now, if you do get any conversions, oh yeah, if you do get any conversions, could you please just notify me in partner attribution.

I will link this channel. But this is how I'm going to start tracking it. And I don't think I'll have the bonus ready for January, but when it's in February, this will be how I'm going to be doing it. Try to say just send a screenshot of the person and then just say what partner it is and then... That's all you need to do and then I'll have a bot run a script on it at the end of the month and count it all up and That'll be perfect.

I bet. Um... Cool. I'll send you those over. And thanks for taking the time tonight. Sorry for missing 8 o'clock.

No, you're good, you're good. It happens.

I will talk to you soon.

Alright, Fisherman. Take care. You as well. Bye-bye. *Squish*. Okay. Okay. And... Remember share, and... . Okay. . Thank you.
