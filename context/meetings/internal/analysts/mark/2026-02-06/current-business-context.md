# Business Context — As of February 6, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is in a rebuilding phase. The server is currently low-activity with only a handful of engaged members (Buble dog, Porusan, Nanu). Dax is individually messaging past members to bring them back, offering free access as an incentive. The Super Bowl (February 8) is two days away. The EV tool release is targeted for mid-February, which will coincide with a marketing push to kick off member acquisition.

## Team

- **Dax (CEO)** — running operations, building bots, managing partnerships, interning at Layup
- **Kaiden** — analyst, most active staff member. Brought in 2 friends as members, converting them onto partners
- **Mark** — analyst, DFS and offshore book access. Second staff member in current check-in round
- **JP** — mod, will be sending Props Madness screenshots once company account is set up
- **Nanu** — mod, active in community
- **Bat Brigade Luke** — being onboarded this weekend
- **Kronos** — being onboarded this weekend
- **Zach (Bellcube)** — developer, responsible for Promobot and ticket system implementation

## Revenue

- **Subscription pricing:** Currently ~$15/month, pivoting to $50/month in early March
- **Projected February subscription revenue:** Low $300s-$400s
- **Partnership revenue:** At least $600 (Dax claiming this month since paying out staff)
- **Projected total February revenue:** At least $1,000
- **30 partners** listed in the conversion database
- **Partnership CPA model:** Staff and members earn conversion points for signups on any DD partner code

## Compensation Model

- **Staff base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue, contingent on 5 conversions per month
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally based on conversion points
- **Conversion points:** 1 point per partner signup (with proof), 3 points per new member who joins premium through invite link
- **Example:** $100 bonus pool, 7 out of 10 total points = $70 payout

## Product State

- **EV tool:** Not yet released. Targeted for mid-February. Key justification for the $50/month price point.
- **Promobot:** Partners listed in database. New feature in development: "claimed" interaction creates a ticket, moderator command auto-applies 7 free days. Should have been done last week — ASAP priority.
- **Welcome tickets:** Planned system to auto-message every new server join. Waiting on Zach to build.
- **Props Madness:** Company account not yet set up. JP will start using once available.
- **Algezine Platinum:** Available for DFS and offshore books. Overlaps significantly with DGF.
- **Low holds page:** Available on OddsJam, shows similar plays to DGF.
- **Discord bots planned:** Novig odds calculator, Kelly criterion calculator, arb calculator, EV calculator, promo converter.

## Layup Partnership

Dax is interning at Layup, a company building sports betting tools:
- Bet tracking bot connected to Discord users (in development)
- AI chat tool in early MVP stage — needs more training data
- Considering tax tracking system for bettors
- Dax planning to track per-user win totals in DD's database from the "greened out" channel
- Mark referred "Huddy" for a Layup call (scheduled Monday at 4 PM)
- $50 gift cards offered for Layup referrals

## Strategic Direction

1. Survive the slow period — retain any members Dax brings back through individual outreach
2. Release EV tool by mid-February
3. Pivot subscription to $50/month in early March
4. Launch marketing push after EV release
5. Build out Promobot ticket system and welcome tickets to automate conversions
6. Build Discord calculator bots to add value
7. Scale staff — onboarding Luke and Kronos this weekend
