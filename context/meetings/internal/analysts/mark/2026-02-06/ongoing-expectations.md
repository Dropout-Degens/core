# Mark Ongoing Expectations — As of February 6, 2026

---

## Role

Analyst

## Background

Mark is a junior at a university in California. He has DFS access and offshore sportsbook experience. He purchased the Platinum version of Algezine for DFS and offshore books. He is canceling his DGF subscription due to overlap. He already practices line shopping using OddsJam, the Novig odds calculator, and Kelly criterion for bet sizing. He typically plays 2-leg EV parlays.

## Current Expectations

- **Analyst picks:** Post picks as schedule allows. Reference tools and research behind picks — explain the "why."
- **Betting education:** Answer member questions, especially from less experienced bettors (e.g., O Sweater). Post educational content at Mark's discretion — e.g., screenshot of an OddsJam play in the NBA channel with an explanation of the reasoning.
- **Screenshots:** Send screenshots of bets and apps whenever possible. Dollar amounts are optional, but showing the apps is important for driving awareness and conversions. Lean into DFS app screenshots as a strength.
- **Seed engagement:** Vote on daily poll. React in daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, and community picks channels.
- **Channel activity:** Be active in assigned channels. Help retain members that Dax brings back through outreach.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 conversions per month required to qualify for 2% base. Submit proof: screenshot of signup + tag the person in partner attribution channel. New premium members through invite link = 3 points each.
- **Welcome tickets:** When available, help answer unanswered tickets from new server joins.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep the 2026 bet tracking spreadsheet up to date once received from Dax.
- **Layup referrals:** Assist with Layup referrals when possible — $50 gift card incentive per referral.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month minimum
- **Projected February revenue base:** At least $1,000 (low $300s-$400s subscription + ~$600 partnership)
- **Subscription price pivot:** $50/month starting early March — will change revenue projections
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally based on conversion points earned across all 30 partners
- **Conversion points:** 1 point per partner signup, 3 points per new premium member through invite link

## Unique Considerations

- **California location:** Limits personal access to most DD partners, but does not affect ability to help members in other states.
- **DFS and offshore access:** Has Underdog, PrizePicks, and offshore books. Platinum Algezine for DFS and offshore EV. This is an advantage for screenshot content.
- **OddsJam workflow:** Uses Novig + Kelly criterion for bet sizing. Dax plans to build these as Discord bots based on Mark's walkthrough.
- **Layup connection:** Referred Huddy for a Layup call. Potential for additional referrals.
