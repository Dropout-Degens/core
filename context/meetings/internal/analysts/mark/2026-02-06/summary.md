# Mark 1:1 Summary — February 6, 2026

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Mark (Analyst)
**Purpose:** Follow-up check-in, compensation structure update, conversion system walkthrough, tools discussion, Layup partnership update

---

## Partnership & App Positioning

Dax reiterated the positioning strategy: staff should be sending screenshots of apps and bets to encourage members to discover and use DD's partner apps. The more apps members see, the more opportunities for conversions on DD's affiliate codes. JP is going to start sending screenshots of Props Madness once the company account is set up. Mark's advantage is that he has most of the DFS apps — Dax asked him to lean into that for screenshot content.

Mark has DFS access and offshore books. He purchased the Platinum version of Algezine for both DFS and offshore. His DGF (Daily Grind Fantasy) subscription was expiring the next day (February 7) and he planned to cancel since the Platinum Algezine covers the same functionality. Discussion touched on the overlap between Algezine Platinum EV tools and DGF's offerings — they are largely the same plays.

## Compensation Structure — Updated

Dax formalized the compensation:
- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription revenue plus partnership revenue
- **Minimum requirement:** 5 conversions per month to qualify for the 2% base
- **Projected February revenue:** Low $300s-$400s subscription + at least $600 partnership = at least $1,000 total
- **Subscription price pivot:** Moving to $50/month starting early March at the latest
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally based on conversion points

Mark agreed the conversion requirement was fair.

## Conversion Points System

Dax walked through the conversion points system in detail:
- All 30 DD partners are listed in a database
- Staff earn points for each conversion on any partner
- Proof required: screenshot of the signup + tag the person who signed up
- Anyone who joins the server through Mark's invite link and joins premium (even through free days) counts as **3 points** because it adds them to DD's membership members table
- The 3-point premium signup conversions also count toward the 5% staff bonus pool
- At end of month, Dax tallies all points and distributes the bonus proportionally (e.g., 7 out of 10 total points = 70% of the bonus)

## Promobot & Ticket System

Dax explained the Promobot expansion:
- Adding an interaction: when a member marks a partner offer as "claimed," it creates an individual ticket in the free access channel
- The ticket allows the member to submit conversion proof
- A moderator command will auto-apply 7 free days to the user
- **Welcome tickets:** Every new server join will receive a message. Staff should help answer unanswered tickets when available.
- Dax will be actively managing and converting through the tickets
- Status: Should have been done last week. Marked as ASAP — waiting on Zach (Bellcube) to implement

## Community Engagement State

Current active members: Buble dog, Porusan, and Nanu. The server is in a slow period. Dax is individually messaging past members to bring them back, offering free access. Super Bowl is in 2 days (February 8). Dax expects a slow start but plans to release the EV tool by mid-February, which will coincide with a marketing push.

Dax emphasized the need for retention — when members come back, staff need to keep them engaged.

## Mark's Role Clarification

Mark asked whether he should focus on just sending plays or also creating betting education content. Dax clarified:
- **Betting education** comes primarily through direct member interaction (e.g., answering questions from less experienced members like O Sweater)
- **Educational content** in channels is at Mark's discretion — for example, posting a screenshot of an OddsJam play in the NBA channel with an explanation of why he's taking it
- **Screenshots of bets** are requested whenever possible — dollar amounts are optional, but showing the apps is important for driving conversions

## Tools & Calculator Discussion

Mark walked Dax through his betting workflow using OddsJam:
- Uses the **Novig odds calculator** to de-vig lines (typically from Pinnacle)
- Feeds the de-vigged percentages into the **Kelly criterion calculator** (quarter Kelly, 0.25 multiplier) to determine bet sizing
- Typically plays 2-leg parlays built from minus-odds EV plays, targeting plus-money combined lines
- Dax offered to build these calculators (Novig + Kelly) as Discord bots for the server
- Other calculators discussed for bot integration: arb calculator, EV calculator, promo converter

## Layup Partnership

Dax shared more about his internship at Layup:
- Got the internship through an entrepreneurship class — Layup liked his note-taking during an interview and offered him a position
- Layup is building sports betting tools tailored to bettors
- Showed Mark the bet tracking bot connected to Discord — can track bets tied to Discord users
- AI chat tool is in early MVP stage (built the previous weekend), needs more training data
- Considering adding a tax tracking system — a feature nobody else offers
- Dax is planning to track staff and member wins in a "greened out" channel, storing totals per user in the database

Mark got "Huddy" to schedule a call with Layup for Monday at 4 PM. Dax mentioned the possibility of another $50 gift card if Mark can get one more referral. Next week is booked but the week after has availability.

## Bet Tracking Spreadsheet

Dax will send Mark an updated 2026 bet tracking spreadsheet and a ChatGPT link for formatting bet data into the spreadsheet. Mark is expected to keep it up to date going forward.

## Staff Updates

- **Kaiden** is the most active staff member — brought in 2 friends as members and is working on converting them onto DD partners
- Dax is onboarding **Bat Brigade Luke** and **Kronos** this weekend
- Mark is the second staff member Dax has spoken to in this round of check-ins

## Key Decisions

- 2% base compensation confirmed — requires 5 conversions per month
- Subscription price moving to $50/month in early March
- Premium server joins through invite links count as 3 conversion points
- Dax to build Novig + Kelly criterion Discord bots
- Promobot ticket system is ASAP priority
- Mark to keep bet tracking spreadsheet updated
- Mark to continue focusing on bet screenshots and member engagement
