# Kaiden — Current Context

**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026
**Role:** Analyst
**Status:** Active — just onboarded

---

## Background

Kaiden is a college student at FSU. He works at Outback. He's been a member of the Dropout Degens Discord since 2023, essentially from day one of the server. He also works with Layup (had a 45-minute onboarding call with them recently).

His girlfriend is a social media influencer with 140,000 TikTok followers and is part of an esports team. Kaiden runs his dad's business Instagram and has knowledge of social media marketing. He's offered to help with DD's social media when the time comes.

## Why He's Here

Kaiden has an NBA prediction model that he's been running independently. He wanted an outlet to share his research with people who understand betting at his level — his girlfriend doesn't get it and he doesn't have friends who bet seriously. He reached out to Dax asking for an analyst channel.

His model is performing well:
- Up 17-18 units overall on his NBA strategy
- The night before his onboarding call, his model predicted two upsets — both hit
- Made 4.7 units off five bets that night

He's motivated by wanting to share his work, not by money. He explicitly said he doesn't care about compensation right now and won't give a half-assed effort even without immediate pay.

## Current Role & Expectations

**Analyst** — posting NBA model picks

- **Daily picks:** Post whenever he has plays. Daily is expected when he has plays. Missing one day is fine; missing four days then posting once then skipping three is not.
- **Daily recaps:** Recap how picks performed before the next day's picks go out.
- **Research framing:** Share the reasoning behind picks so members can learn.
- **Member recruitment:** Invite people using his tracked invite link. Has a Snapchat group chat with ~50 FSU students who talk about sports betting.
- **Social media (future):** Help with marketing once the community is more active (20+ daily active members).

He said he's ready to start immediately — as soon as the channel is up, he'll post.

## Compensation

- **Base:** Not set. Kaiden said he doesn't care about money right now.
- **Staff bonus:** Included in the 5% monthly bonus pool. Earns points for conversions and invite-based referrals. Double points if he both invites and converts someone.

## Access & Setup

- [ ] Analyst channel created
- [ ] Notify role set up
- [ ] Tracked invite link provided
- [ ] Added to Routine organization (company workspace)
- [ ] Login credentials for DD website sent
- [ ] Documentation on how to post picks/recaps sent

## Unique Value

- Working NBA model with real edge (17-18 units up)
- Motivated and ready to contribute immediately
- Social media knowledge through girlfriend and personal experience
- Connected to ~50 FSU students who bet on sports
- Thinking ahead about offshore options (asked about Bet105 for when he gets limited)

## Notes

- Asked about Bet105 because he's worried about getting limited by sportsbooks if his model keeps winning. Dax explained it's offshore, crypto deposit, 5% vig, welcomes arbitrage bettors.
- Kaiden's only offshore experience was Stake before it had a U.S. version.
