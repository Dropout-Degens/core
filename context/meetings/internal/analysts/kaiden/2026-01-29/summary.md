**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Kaiden (Analyst)
**Purpose:** Recruitment pitch, education-first pivot overview, role discussion, onboarding

---

## Background

Kaiden has been a member of the Dropout Degens Discord since 2023 — essentially from day one of the server. He previously DMed Dax asking about getting an analyst channel to share his NBA model picks. He's a college student at FSU, works at Outback, and has a girlfriend who is a social media influencer (140,000 TikTok followers, part of an esports team). Kaiden also runs his dad's business Instagram and has knowledge of social media marketing.

Kaiden mentioned he also works with Layup. He had a 45-minute conversation with them recently. He was caught off guard when they asked what bank he uses but understood it after Dax explained they're a fintech company.

## Dax's Layup Work

Dax shared that he's been interning with Layup for almost a year, starting around March 2025. It's a paid internship. Through Layup, he's been exposed to startup terminology and has spoken to many bettors. He noted that bettors often have strategies and resources but no place to discuss them — they just tail picks in Discords and blame the tipsters when things go wrong.

## Education-First Pivot

Dax walked Kaiden through the company's three stages:

- **Year 1:** Broke off from the Fliff server. Scaled to about 3,000 members organically. Built first partnerships (three to five).
- **Year 2:** Scaled partnerships from 3-5 to 25. Never ran paid marketing — stayed organic. Failed to scale conversions alongside partnerships. Staff weren't focused on converting members to partnerships.
- **Year 3 (current):** Community is dead. Repositioning to be education-first. The goal is not just to send profitable picks but to teach members how to use resources and understand the strategies behind picks.

The positioning shift: instead of "tail this pick," it's "take this pick because I did X, Y, Z research — here's how you can replicate it." Dax wants members to become analysts themselves, equipped with knowledge to fact-check picks and find their own bets. He described it as essentially a course on how to create your own betting Discord, but framed as a community rather than a course.

Kaiden responded positively, noting that he personally does research first and then checks the Discord to see if others agree — using the community to validate his thinking.

## Partnership Economics

Dax explained the customer LTV model:

- Current LTV per customer: approximately $1,400 across all partnership CPAs (deposit-based payouts)
- Projected LTV after Dax turns 21 (in about two weeks): $2,000-$2,500 with additional partnerships
- Previous paid acquisition cost: $0.25 per customer (organic)
- Potential paid acquisition: $1-5 per customer via Meta ads once conversion funnel is validated
- Only need a low conversion rate to be profitable given the LTV

## Growth Strategy

Dax outlined three approaches:

1. **Community re-engagement:** Not a priority. The existing demographic (Fliff users who don't really know how to bet) has already churned. They'll naturally re-engage over time as the server gets more active.
2. **Community acquisition:** Actively pursuing. Dax is in talks with communities to merge. The deal structure is a percentage of Dropout Degens revenue (4-5%) rather than a cash buyout. This brings members, analysts, and mods.
3. **Paid acquisition (Meta ads):** Not until product-market fit is validated. Need to prove return on ad spend before scaling.

Dax mentioned wanting 20 daily active members chatting before focusing on social media and paid marketing — the server needs to have something for new members to come into.

## Staff and Compensation Structure

Dax explained the current breakdown:

- **20% of revenue** goes to a bonus fund (covers operating costs, marketing budget, with Dax covering any negative balance out of pocket)
- **10% for head staff:** JP, Dante, and developer Zach. Dante may not be sticking around.
- **10% for analysts:** Each analyst gets around 1-2% revenue share
- **5% staff bonus:** Point-based system. Staff earn points for conversions (getting members to sign up for partners using DD's code) and invites (tracked invite links). Points translate to a proportional share of the 5% pool.
- **Double points:** If a staff member both invites someone and converts them, they get points for both.

Operating costs are minimal — sub-$50/month for Google Cloud hosting and AI subscriptions.

Dax noted compensation hasn't been going well because revenue is low and analysts weren't focused on conversions, just on sending picks. The 5% bonus is a new incentive structure to encourage the education-first approach and drive partnership conversions.

## Tools and Integrations

Dax mentioned several tools:

- **Props Cache bot:** Shows last five plays, integrated into Discord
- **Outlier Insights:** Sends daily trends
- **OddsJam EV:** Collecting data for about two years (2,000+ alerts per day). Building filters on top of OddsJam's algorithm to identify high-performing markets. Goal is to send 5-10 best plays daily based on when OddsJam's 60% confidence predictions actually hit 80% of the time.
- **Daily Grind Fantasy:** Also collecting data
- **Partner Promo Bot:** Shows available partners by state and age. Future automation will create tickets when members claim a partner.
- **Routine:** Dax's calendar/notes app where company information is stored. Staff will get access to view goals, projects, and partner resources.

## Kaiden's Role

Kaiden is coming on as an **analyst**. He has an NBA model that he's been running independently. Key points:

- Kaiden's model predicted two upsets the night before, both hit. He made 4.7 units off five bets. He's up 17-18 units on his NBA strategy.
- He was looking for an outlet to share his research — his girlfriend doesn't understand it and he doesn't have friends who bet at his level.
- Kaiden explicitly said he doesn't care about compensation right now. He enjoys what he does and wants to help the Discord succeed. He won't give a half-assed effort just because he's not getting paid immediately.
- He wants to start immediately — if the channel is up tomorrow, he'll be posting tomorrow.

Expectations set:
- **Daily picks:** Post whenever he has plays. Missing one day is fine; missing four days in a row then posting once then skipping three is not.
- **Daily recaps:** Recap how picks performed before the next day's picks.
- **Research framing:** Share the reasoning behind picks so members can ask questions and learn.
- **Staff bonus eligibility:** Kaiden will be included in the 5% bonus pool regardless of whether he takes a base percentage.

## Social Media Offer

Kaiden offered to help with social media marketing when the time comes. He runs his dad's business Instagram and gets knowledge from his girlfriend who has 140,000 TikTok followers. Dax said social media is on the table but they need an active community first (20 daily active members) before focusing on marketing.

Kaiden mentioned Betterment's approach of using people like Derek as faces for the brand on TikTok/Instagram. Dax acknowledged he's awful at social media content and wouldn't be a good face himself. Faceless content has been considered.

## Bet105 Discussion

Kaiden asked about Bet105 because he's worried about sportsbooks limiting him if his NBA model keeps performing. He'd heard Bet105 doesn't limit winners. Dax explained:

- Bet105 is an offshore/bookie site, likely crypto deposit
- They welcome arbitrage bettors and only take a 5% vig (hence "105")
- DD just added them back to the partnership list because California banned everything else
- Dax hasn't personally used Bet105 but is in contact with them and will share more info

Kaiden's only offshore experience was Stake before it had a U.S. version.

## Member Recruitment

Dax asked Kaiden to invite people to the server. Kaiden said he's in a Snapchat group chat with about 50 FSU students who talk about sports betting constantly. He'll invite them. Dax will give Kaiden a tracked invite link so all invites are attributed to him.

Dax mentioned he's giving away free premium generously — anyone Kaiden invites can get 30 free days. The $50/month subscription price is mainly to validate positioning and incentivize partnership conversions, not to gatekeep.

## Next Steps

- Dax to create Kaiden's analyst channel immediately after the call
- Dax to set up a notify role for Kaiden
- Dax to give Kaiden a tracked invite link
- Dax to add Kaiden to the Routine organization so he can see goals, projects, and partner resources
- Dax to send follow-up with login instructions for the DD website and staff role assignment
- Kaiden to start posting as soon as the channel is live
- Future: Kaiden to help with social media once the community is more active
