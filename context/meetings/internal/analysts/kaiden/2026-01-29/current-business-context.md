# Business Context — As of January 29, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is repositioning from a picks-focused Discord to an education-first sports betting community. The community is currently dead — Dax described it as having about 50-100 monthly active members, which is very low. The server needs about 20 daily active members chatting before Dax will focus on social media and paid marketing.

The company has been through three stages:
- **Year 1:** Broke off from the Fliff server, grew to ~3,000 members organically, secured first partnerships (3-5)
- **Year 2:** Scaled partnerships from 3-5 to 25, stayed organic (never ran paid ads), failed to scale conversions alongside partnerships
- **Year 3 (current):** Community has declined, now repositioning as education-first

The goal is to teach members how to use resources and understand strategies behind picks, not just send picks to tail. Dax described it as wanting to make every member into an analyst — essentially a course on how to create your own betting Discord, but framed as a community.

## Team

- **Dax (CEO):** Managing everything solo on the business development side. Balancing school (not doing great grade-wise), a paid internship at Layup (almost a year), and Dropout Degens. Described himself as awful at social media content.
- **JP (Head Staff/Mod):** One of three head staff members receiving a percentage of revenue.
- **Dante (Head Staff/Analyst):** May not be sticking around much longer. Status uncertain.
- **Zach (Developer):** Part-time, has another job. Dax noted "he doesn't really do half the shit I ask him."
- **Other analysts:** Activity is inconsistent. Analysts have been focused on sending picks, not on conversions.
- **Kaiden (new):** Being onboarded as an analyst on this call. Has an NBA model that's up 17-18 units. Motivated and ready to start immediately.

Staff is described as "depreciated" — Dax onboarded people about a month ago but they trickled out because the positioning wasn't ready and there weren't many members coming in.

## Revenue

- Subscription revenue is minimal (server is dead)
- No partnership revenue being actively claimed
- LTV per customer: approximately $1,400 across all partnership CPAs currently
- Projected LTV after Dax turns 21 (in about two weeks): $2,000-$2,500 with additional partnerships
- Previous paid acquisition cost: $0.25 per customer (organic)
- Potential future acquisition cost: $1-5 per customer via Meta ads once conversion funnel is validated
- Operating costs: Sub-$50/month (Google Cloud, ChatGPT/Claude subscription, hosting)

The compensation structure:
- 20% to bonus fund (operating costs, marketing)
- 10% to head staff (JP, Dante, Zach)
- 10% to analysts (1-2% each)
- 5% to monthly bonus pool (point-based, for conversions and invites)

Compensation hasn't been working well because revenue is low and analysts weren't focused on conversions.

## Product State

- **Props Cache bot:** Integrated, shows last five plays. Underutilized.
- **Outlier Insights:** Sends daily trends. Integrated.
- **OddsJam EV:** Collecting data for ~2 years (2,000+ alerts per day). Building filters to identify high-performing markets. Goal is to send 5-10 best plays daily.
- **Daily Grind Fantasy:** Also collecting data.
- **Partner Promo Bot:** Shows available partners by state and age. Future automation will create tickets when members claim a partner.
- **Tracked invite links:** Functional through Dropout Degens bot. Every staff member gets a unique link.
- **Routine (company workspace):** Dax's calendar/notes app storing all company information. Staff will get access to view goals, projects, and partner resources.
- **Social media:** Dead. Instagram was handed off to someone else and died. Not a priority until community is active (20 daily active members).

## Partnerships

- 25 current partnerships
- Includes social sportsbooks, DFS apps, tools (Props Cache, Outlier, OddsJam, Daily Grind Fantasy)
- Bet105 recently added back (offshore, crypto deposit, 5% vig, welcomes arbitrage bettors)
- Major sportsbooks (FanDuel, DraftKings, MGM) will be available once Dax turns 21

## Growth Strategy

1. **Community re-engagement:** Low priority. Existing members (largely Fliff users) have churned. They'll re-engage naturally as the server becomes more active.
2. **Community acquisition:** Active priority. Dax is in talks with communities to merge. Deal structure is revenue share (4-5%) rather than cash buyout.
3. **Paid acquisition (Meta ads):** Not until product-market fit is proven. Need to validate return on ad spend before scaling.

Target before marketing push: 20 daily active members chatting in the Discord.

## Strategic Direction

1. Finish education-first positioning by the Super Bowl
2. Get community active with current and new staff
3. Acquire another community for quick member base growth
4. Validate conversion funnel with organic traffic
5. Scale through social media and paid acquisition once unit economics are proven

The key insight Dax shared: through his Layup work, he's learned that bettors have strategies and resources but no place to discuss them. They just tail picks and blame tipsters when things go wrong. DD wants to be the place where bettors actually learn and share knowledge.
