# Luke Ongoing Expectations — As of February 11, 2026

---

## Role

Analyst

## Background

Luke recently moved to LA (Culver City area, near Santa Monica) to pursue a career in the film industry. Living with two college friends. He follows and posts picks for NBA and NFL. His primary research tool is Linemate (paid subscription), supplemented by DD's outlier channels, mobile trend apps, and reading articles. He does not pay for any other subscriptions.

## Current Expectations

- **Daily picks:** Post picks for NBA and NFL as schedule allows. Can post during the week — no issues with this.
- **Community engagement:** Primarily on weekends. Weekdays are limited given his schedule in LA.
- **Reactions:** React to posts across the server, especially in channels only Dax posts in (daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, community picks). Reactions signal value to new members and build engagement habits.
- **Respond to pings:** Occasional weekday pings are expected — quick responses like explaining reasoning behind a pick.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 per month to qualify for 2% base. Tag user + app name in partner attribution channel with proof. Copy user ID via right-click → Copy User ID, format as `<@USER_ID>`.
- **Invite link:** Use tracked invite link for all server invites. Premium joins through link = 3 conversion points. If Luke both invites and converts someone = double points.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep 2026 spreadsheet updated once received from Dax.
- **Value positioning:** When posting picks, add context about which partner apps are relevant (e.g., "you can take this on ProfitX for better lines"). Not just picks — education and partner awareness.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month minimum
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Proportional distribution based on conversion points
- **Point values vary by partner:** Sleeper = 5 points, Underdog = 3 points (based on commission value)
- **Invite link premium joins:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** Invite + convert same person
- Luke agreed this structure sounds good

## Unique Considerations

- **LA / film industry:** Schedule is busier during the week. Weekend engagement is the realistic expectation.
- **Linemate user:** Primary research tool. DD reaching out for a partnership — potential free account for Luke.
- **Research approach:** Knowledge-driven (articles, trends, outlier data) rather than tool-heavy. Dax noted the knowledge aspect is as valuable as app-driven research.
- **NBA and NFL focus:** These are his two main sports for picks.
