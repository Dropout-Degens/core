---

## Personal Update

Luke moved to LA — right outside Culver City, near Santa Monica, about 30 minutes west of Hollywood. He's pursuing a career in the film industry. Living with two friends from college.

## Business Repositioning Overview

Dax walked Luke through the three-year arc of Dropout Degens:

1. **Year 1:** Broke off from Flip-Flops. Focused on scaling members — grew from 0 to 3,000.
2. **Year 2:** Focused on partnerships. Scaled to ~20 partnerships. But conversion rates stayed flat at 3-5 per partner per month — revenue didn't scale with partner count.
3. **Year 3 (current):** Tried acquisitions and bringing in more staff, but onboarded too many without aligning them on revenue generation. Staff fell off because pay was bad and they weren't driving conversions. Bad cycle.

**Current focus:** Bringing out the value aspect of the Discord. It's not just about picks — it's about teaching members how to use DD's partnerships and integrations. The goal is that analysts organically direct members to partner apps in context (e.g., "if you're in XX state, you could take this on ProfitX for better lines than FanDuel").

## Tools & Research

Luke's current research stack:
- **Linemate** (main app — paid subscription)
- DD's outlier channels
- A few mobile apps for trends
- Reading articles for NBA and NFL

Dax noted Linemate as a partnership outreach target — DD has had them on the list but never reached out. If DD gets a code, they could potentially get Luke a free account.

Dax mentioned he'll be distributing company accounts to analysts based on what each person would actually use. Luke is last in the 1-on-1 round (with possibly 1-2 more analysts being picked up).

## Conversion Points System

Dax walked through the conversion system:
- All DD partners are in a database with point values based on commission worth (e.g., Sleeper = 5 points, Underdog = 3 points because commission is $35)
- To claim a conversion: tag the person who signed up + name the app in the partner attribution channel
- Copy user ID: right-click → Copy User ID, wrap in `<@USER_ID>` format

### Staff Bonus Pool
- 5% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue goes into the bonus pool
- Distributed proportionally by points (e.g., 5 out of 10 points = 50% of pool)
- Dax is excluded from the staff bonus pool

### Invite Link Attribution
- Luke will receive a unique tracked invite link
- Anyone who joins through his link and converts = Luke gets the points even if someone else (usually Dax) does the conversion
- If Luke both invites AND converts = double points
- New premium members through invite link = 3 conversion points

## Compensation Structure

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month to qualify for 2% base
- **Projected February revenue:** At least $500, possibly $1,000-$1,250 range (Dax claiming a partnership payout this month)
- **Staff bonus:** At least $50 this month from conversion pool
- Luke agreed the structure sounds good

## Capacity & Engagement

- **Daily picks:** Luke can post daily picks during the week — no issue
- **Community engagement/chatting:** Primarily weekends. Weekdays are harder given his schedule
- **Reactions:** Dax asked Luke to react to as many posts as possible, especially in channels only Dax posts in (daily free picks, partner promos). Reactions signal value to new members and build engagement habits
- **Pings:** Luke will get occasional pings during the week for quick responses (e.g., "why I'm taking this pick")

## Upcoming

- Dax sending documents covering everything discussed (target: by the weekend)
- Updated 2026 bet tracking spreadsheets for all analysts
- Partner promos resuming in daily play of the day (schedule being rebuilt)
- Weekly analyst call happening in ~5 minutes after this call

## Key Outcomes

- Luke understands DD's repositioning toward value/education over just picks
- Conversion system and compensation structure explained and agreed upon
- Capacity aligned: daily picks yes, community engagement on weekends, reactions anytime
- Linemate added to partnership outreach list
- Tracked invite link to be sent immediately after call
