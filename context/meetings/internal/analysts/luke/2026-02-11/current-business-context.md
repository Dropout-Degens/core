# Business Context — As of February 11, 2026 (Luke 1:1)

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is repositioning from a picks-focused Discord to a value-driven community centered on teaching members to use DD's partnership ecosystem. The server has ~20 active partnerships but conversion rates have been stuck at 3-5 per partner per month — revenue didn't scale with partner count. Previous attempts at scaling through acquisitions and adding staff failed because new staff weren't onboarded on revenue generation and fell off when payments were low.

## Three-Year Arc

1. **Year 1:** Split from Flip-Flops. Scaled 0 → 3,000 members.
2. **Year 2:** Scaled partnerships to ~20. Revenue didn't follow.
3. **Year 3:** Tried acquisitions and more staff — bad cycle of low pay → low effort → low revenue. Now focused on value and education.

## Revenue

- **January revenue:** ~$300 (subscription only)
- **Projected February revenue:** $500-$1,250 range (Dax claiming partnership payout this month)
- **Subscription pricing:** Pivoting to $50/month (early March)
- **Official staff payments starting:** February 2026

## Compensation Model

- **Staff base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month to qualify for base
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points
- **Conversion points:** Vary by partner value (Sleeper = 5 pts, Underdog = 3 pts based on commission)
- **Premium joins via invite link:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** If same person both invites and converts
- **Dax excluded** from staff bonus pool

## Team Status

- Luke is the last analyst in the current 1-on-1 check-in round
- Dax may pick up 1-2 more analysts
- Kaiden most active staff member (from Mark 02-06 context)

## Strategic Direction

The key insight: it's not just about posting picks — it's about contextually directing members to partner apps. Example: an analyst posts a pick and notes "if you're in [state], you can get better lines on ProfitX." The EV tool (coming soon) will make this even easier — members can see a filtered pick and naturally discover which app is best for placing it.

## Partnership Outreach

- **Linemate** added to outreach list based on Luke's usage — his primary research tool, has a paid subscription
- DD has had Linemate on their list but never reached out
- Potential to get Luke a free account through a partnership code
