# Luke — Current Context

**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026
**Role:** Analyst
**Status:** Active — just onboarded

---

## Background

Luke recently moved to LA (right outside Culver City, near Santa Monica, ~30 minutes west of Hollywood) to pursue a career in the film industry. He's living with two friends from college. He previously went by "Bat Brigade Luke" in the server.

He follows NBA and NFL as his two main sports. His research approach is knowledge-driven — reading articles, tracking trends, and using apps rather than relying on heavy tool subscriptions. He does not pay for any subscriptions other than Linemate.

## Current Role & Expectations

**Analyst** — daily picks, weekend community engagement, conversion driver

- **Daily picks:** Post NBA and NFL picks during the week. No issues with this part of the schedule.
- **Community engagement:** Primarily weekends. Weekdays are limited due to his LA schedule.
- **Reactions:** React to as many posts as possible, especially in channels only Dax posts in (daily free picks, partner promos, greened out, community picks). Reactions signal value to new members.
- **Respond to pings:** Available for occasional weekday pings (e.g., quick reasoning behind a pick).
- **Value positioning:** When posting picks, add context about which partner apps are relevant (e.g., "you can take this on ProfitX for better lines"). Not just picks — education and partner awareness.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 per month required. Tag user + app name in partner attribution channel with proof.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep 2026 spreadsheet up to date (Dax to send, will also backfill 2026 picks).

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue (requires 5 conversions/month)
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points
- **Point values vary by partner:** Based on commission value (e.g., Sleeper = 5 pts, Underdog = 3 pts)
- **Premium joins via invite link:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** If Luke both invites and converts the same person
- **Dax excluded** from staff bonus pool
- Luke agreed the structure sounds good

## Access & Setup

- [ ] Tracked invite link sent (Dax sending immediately after 02-11 call)
- [ ] Bet tracking spreadsheet sent (Dax to backfill 2026 and send)
- [ ] ChatGPT link for formatting bet data into spreadsheet sent
- [ ] Company account assigned (DGF confirmed in weekly meeting; determining others based on what Luke would use)
- [ ] Documentation on compensation/conversion system sent (target: by the weekend)

## Tools & Research

- **Linemate** (primary tool — paid subscription). DD reaching out for a partnership, potential free account for Luke
- DD outlier channels
- Mobile apps for trends
- Articles and news for NBA and NFL
- No other paid subscriptions

## Unique Considerations

- **LA / film industry:** Weekday availability is limited. Weekend engagement is the realistic commitment.
- **Linemate user:** His primary research tool. Added to DD partnership outreach list — if DD gets a code, Luke could get a free account.
- **Knowledge-driven research:** Dax noted this is as valuable as app-driven research. Luke doesn't rely on heavy tool subscriptions.
- **NBA and NFL focus:** His two main sports for picks.
- **Not yet 21:** Mentioned in the weekly meeting context — affects access to some partners (e.g., Better).
