**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Dante (Former Head Analyst)
**Purpose:** Role transition discussion, feedback on analyst tracking systems, education-first positioning review

## Work Schedule and Discord Access

Dante works at a bank. His schedule has him out of the house at 8am and home between 4pm and 6pm depending on the day. He tried to get Discord access on the work computers as discussed in a previous meeting, but it's blocked. The bank's computers run locked-down software — they can't access anything except ESPN. They couldn't even access Cool Math Games. The only game available was Solitaire on Microsoft Edge.

This means Dante can only send play of the day picks during his lunch break or when there are no customers and he's not doing emails. He described it as trying to quickly find a play, screenshot it, and send it over.

Dante acknowledged he's been dreading telling Dax this because he knows he can't contribute as much as he used to.

## Role Transition

Dante said he doesn't want to ask for specific roles or money given his limited availability. He wants to keep helping with play of the day until Dax finds someone to take over that spot, then pass the torch. He doesn't want to just leave out of nowhere.

Dax asked if Dante could take a mod role focused on community engagement (evenings after work). Dante said he'd try it but didn't want to give false hope — some days he gets home and has energy, other days he just wants to lay in bed.

Dax decided not to put Dante under the pressure of mod responsibilities. The agreed outcome:

- **Move Dante from Head Analyst to All-Access member**
- **Keep the staff badge** (yellow "Alexis" role) as recognition
- **Continue play of the day** when Dante can get them out
- **Revisit in 1-2 months** — if Dante is active as a member, they'll discuss bringing him back to the mod team

Dax mentioned he's building an EV-based fallback so that if Dante can't get the play of the day out, Dax can pull a play from the partner-specific EV data instead.

## Play of the Day Timing

Dax explained his constraints: he has a gap between 11am and 1pm, then class and work until 5pm. If he doesn't get the play of the day out by noon or 1pm, it's hard to get it out until 5pm, by which point it's too late. He also has a problem with opening Discord DMs, losing the notification, and forgetting to post.

Neither Dax nor Dante has a reliable system for getting POTD out on time consistently.

## Feedback on Analyst Tracking Systems

Dax asked Dante for feedback on tracking systems since Dante has experience with everything they've tried:

**myodds.bet (visual tracking site):**
- Dante remembered seeing it but didn't use it much
- Better visualization than spreadsheets
- Required a lot of manual work to maintain

**Spreadsheets:**
- Easy to adjust to
- The tracking itself wasn't hard
- Main issue was staying consistent — if you miss one day, it snowballs into two or three missed days

**Pickett (bet tracking app):**
- Dante used it before spreadsheets
- It was okay but wanted too much money for the pro features
- Sync aspect wasn't significantly easier than spreadsheets

**Key insights from Dante:**
- The system (spreadsheet) is fine — the problem is personal habits
- "Earlier the better" — input plays as soon as you make them, don't wait until later
- Once a play is already in the spreadsheet, marking win/loss/push is easy
- Getting behind is what kills consistency
- "Laziness is what can really kill you"
- It's person-dependent — some people can easily catch up, others can't

Dax said he'll keep spreadsheets as the tracking system because they provide good team-level data on analyst performance.

## Education-First Positioning Feedback

Dax shared the education-first repositioning:

- Previously: "Sign up for a partner and get 7 or 30 free days" — didn't deliver actual value from partnerships
- Now: Focus on educating members on how to use tools (Props Cache bot, Outlier Insights, OddsJam EV) so they understand the value and eventually convert
- Teaching members why to use units, how to be more disciplined, how to be more profitable

Dante's response: "It's fine. I don't really hear anything crazy against it."

## Conversion Discussion

Dax noted that all staff except himself have gotten basically zero partner conversions (unless converting themselves). He's building a point system:

- Staff get custom invite links (tracked)
- Points for referring someone to the server
- Points for converting someone onto a partner
- 5% bonus pool distributed based on points

Dax asked Dante why conversions were low. Dante's feedback:

- **Usability:** He couldn't use a majority of the partners (Connecticut restrictions)
- **Advertising:** Partners need to be pushed more — they're not visible enough in channels
- **Presence:** The resources exist but aren't present in places where staff can naturally reference them

Dax asked if having a company Props Cache account would have helped. Dante said no — nothing would make Props Cache easier specifically. The issue isn't the tools themselves, it's getting them in front of members.

Dax showed Dante the partner database with copy-paste promo text. Dante said he personally wouldn't use it (not a tech guy), but acknowledged it could help more tech-savvy staff. The key is just getting partners pushed out more so members see them.

## Member Recruitment

Dax asked if Dante has friends who bet that aren't in the server. Dante said not really — he's been locked in at work and hasn't been betting much.

Dax asked about Migs (a former member). Dante talks to him occasionally but they're not close. Migs is still betting. Dax has been messaging Migs but keeps getting left on read. Dante agreed to reach out and see if Migs wants to come back to the community.

Dax mentioned he's giving free premium to anyone who joins and is a real person — Dante can invite anyone and they'll get free access.

## Next Steps

- Dax to move Dante from Head Analyst to All-Access member role
- Dante keeps staff badge
- Dante continues sending play of the day when possible
- Group chat with JP continues
- Dante to reach out to Migs about rejoining the community
- Revisit Dante's role in 1-2 months based on activity level
