# Dante Ongoing Expectations — As of February 1, 2026

---

## Role

All-Access Member (formerly Head Analyst)

## Background

Dante was a Head Analyst for Dropout Degens. He works at a bank with a restrictive work environment — out of the house at 8am, home between 4pm and 6pm. Discord is blocked on work computers. He can only contribute during lunch break or slow moments when there are no customers. His availability after work is inconsistent — some days he has energy, some days he just wants to go to bed.

Dante acknowledged he can't provide as much as he used to. He didn't want to ask for specific roles or compensation given his constraints. He offered to keep helping with play of the day until someone else can take over, then pass the torch. He keeps his staff badge as recognition of his tenure.

## Current Expectations

- **Play of the day:** Send when possible. No hard deadline, but Dax prefers before noon. Dante will send during lunch break or slow moments at work. This is appreciated but not strictly required.

- **Community presence:** Be active in the server as a member when energy and schedule allow. No specific KPIs or engagement requirements.

- **Member recruitment:** Reach out to Migs (former member) about rejoining. Invite anyone who bets — Dax is giving free premium to anyone who joins.

## Compensation

- **None.** Dante explicitly said he's not asking for money given his limited availability.
- **Staff badge retained** as recognition (yellow "Alexis" role)

## Review Period

Revisit in 1-2 months. If Dante is active in the community as a member and his schedule allows, he may be brought back onto the mod team with more formal responsibilities.

## Key Context

Dante provided valuable feedback on analyst tracking systems:
- Spreadsheets work fine as a system — the issue is personal habits and consistency
- "Earlier the better" — input plays immediately, don't wait until later
- Missing one day leads to snowballing into multiple missed days
- Partners need more visibility in channels for staff to naturally reference them in conversations
