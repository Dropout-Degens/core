Hello? How's it going?

What's going on?

How you been brother?

Not much, man. How you doing?

Doing good doing good You've been busy lately?

slammed absolutely slammed especially because Martin Luther King Day everything just fucked up the whole week yeah the snow Yeah, and then the bank closed another day. Yeah, they ended up closing the bank Monday, which was shocking. Yeah.

The snow is crazy up here. I'm sure you got tons, too.

We got 15.

You got more than me. What the fuck?

Yeah, we got dude we got 15 and you know where my ass still went I still shoveled my shit to go to the liquor store 11 a.m.

I was shoveling my car out of 15 inches of snow just walking to the liquor store I'll be 21 soon so that'll be me except I got the liquor store right across the corner yes sir I love it But yeah, wait, so like with your job, I know we talked about last time, maybe you'd be able to get Discord on one of the computers, but...

I looked into that. It was blocked. I was so pressed. No way. It's blocked? They block like everything, dude.

Like is the– what's blocked? Is it the application or is it the website?

So how it is, is the computers that we use they have their own like, I want to say software. So like when you boot up the computer, it's the whole, like, again, I'm not a tech guy, so I don't know how to explain it the best, but like, Whenever I sign on to the computer, it's like their own like service I guess so it's like literally like very minimal like the only site i can use is like espn it's like the only fun site so yeah like we can't even go on cool math games like that's how bad it is that's crazy we were bored one day and we're like yo let's just play some games on the computer we couldn't even get a single game on the computer that's actually kind of wild only game we were able to play was the solitaire that's on microsoft edge That is not real.

So that's annoying. Yeah, that sucks.

Because if that was the case, that would have been so much easier because I can have it on, like, my corner of my screen.

Yeah, yeah.

While I'm at work.

Yeah, and then just...

hide it if anybody comes by yeah exactly but it's like that i know like i've been dreading telling you this but i know it's really hard and i don't know if i'm going to be able to progress as much as i thought i would have been able to no it's and it's all right um and i guess like just tell me what your work schedule looks like again pretty much the whole like week I'm out of the house at 8 and I'm not home till like some days 4 and then there's other days like 6 o'clock Yeah, so I guess like you're just getting the play of the days on your lunch break then?

Exactly. Or I try to slip them like when there's no customers in the fucking place and I'm not having to do emails and shit. I try to like find it real quick, screenshot it, send it over.

Yeah, so you need those taken off your plate, basically.

Well, I don't mind doing the PODs. At the end of the day, I know I can't provide as much as I used to. And so that's why I'm not asking for any specific rules. I'm not going to ask for money.

I'm not going to ask for any of that.

Honestly, I just want to keep helping with the PODs, stuff like that, until, say, you find somebody. that's willing to take up that spot. And then I can in court, like, pass the torch to them I guess you could say Yeah, so I guess... I don't want to just leave out of nowhere, you know what I mean?

No, no, no, yeah, you're good. And I guess, like, just... For the play of the day, let me give you kind of my thoughts and how it works for me. Okay. Play the day like I'm trying to get those out by midday It is sometimes hard for me because like my I'll send you my class schedule but like I have a gap between 11 and basically one And so that's when I have like the time and then I'm in class and then working until 5:00 So it's kind of hard for me to not if I don't get the play of the day out by like one or noon on some days, it's hard for me to get it out.

So until like five and then it's like too late or I might also, I have the problem of like opening the Discord DM and then I also have so many Discord DMs. So like I'll open it and I won't have the notification anymore because like I'll be like, oh, I have to do this in class and then I forget about it.

And then I'll just completely forget to set out the play of the day, which is, that's completely my fault. But it's just like, Scheduling wise, it's... It is easier and I don't want to put a deadline on you because of your job but I am thinking of possibly when I build out our EV substituting some of the if you aren't able to get the play of the day I'll have the fallback of the partner specific EV to just grab a play from gotcha yeah I mean that's definitely cool And then I guess like to go on to the other point of like the more staff role, I think Uh, yeah, and so, I guess you don't have time to post, right, either, and that's something we talked about last time.

Mm-hmm.

So I guess like... For community wise, would you still be around enough when it comes to actually betting and using the community? Do you think you'd be able to take up a mod role or do you think you just want to be a user in the community?

I mean, I'll try the mod rule for a little bit, see how it goes. I don't want to give false hope to you. or anything like I feel like I can try it out see how it ends up going But I know it's either going to be just a member or a mod rule.

I feel like those are going to be in between the two, Beth.

That makes sense, yeah. So I guess like... From for me there is there is not too much on the mod roles like that actually mods have to do it's like just the community engagement right now like we the because we're just a little bit dead and it's while I'm working on all this stuff operationally and like trying to develop us business development it's kind of hard when I also have to stop every five minutes and can't get into my work sessions and like and also to work on keeping the discord engaged um so like that's where i've been really struggling um so i guess like when it comes to and this would be of course like more for later at nights when you're not working uh for example but like would you have that availability to be active and do you think you'd be i mean honestly i'll be honest it all depends today there's gonna be some days where i'll get home from work and i have no problem i'll be awake as Can be.

Then there's going to be some days I get home from work and I don't want to do nothing besides lay in bed and go to bed.

Yeah, yeah. I feel that. I feel that. Okay, so I guess just from my thoughts, I don't want to... I don't want to put you under the pressure of like the responsibilities of a mod role. And then also like, But I do like I do want to keep you around. So like, would you be okay? And still, I'd still love to play the other day, so this would be still really helpful. But to just take a lot of the responsibilities off you, if we just moved you back to an all-access position, and for you to just focus on being an active member of the community that way.

That's cool.

Okay, cool. I can... I'll give you, I'll let you keep your staff role too. Your little, your little, Say that. Yeah, you can have like the yellow, you'll have the yellow Alexis like roll, but you'll get your stab badge and like And we'll just keep it this way for about a month or two. And we'll kind of just like, if you're active and actually we see you active and it's not too bad based on your work schedule, then we'll chat and get you onto the mod team again.

But I don't want to put you under a position where we put you into the mod and then you feel too pressured and don't end up doing anything.

I get what you're saying for sure. Yeah, no, I like that idea. That's cool.

Awesome. So I'll just make that note to move you back to the... just that. Oh, access role? One more thing. Let me check this real quick. We just got a new partner, so let me see if they're legal for you. Actually, you might like them. Let's see. Nope, not Connecticut, never mind. But I guess like the other thing would be like if you do have plays the biggest part of our community engagement is like just If you have any plays that you're sending and it doesn't matter if you have like five bucks placed on them or like 25 like it would be really helpful if you sent them out and any of the channels and just like yeah any discussion around that Got you.

And then, Can we take a moment to go back and Because I'm trying to figure out what would be a better way to do the staff tracking. And I know you're not in the analyst position anymore, but you've had kind of like the experience of like everything that we've been through. So do you mind if I like ask you some questions on that?

I mean, I'll answer them to the best of my ability, but yeah, sure. Like, okay, cool.

So do you remember when we used myodds.bet? Oh.

Not really, to be honest.

Let me see, I don't have the site login, but I have screenshots of it somewhere. Let me find that screenshot. Actually, it's probably like. One of my DMs. Give me like two seconds and I'll find a screenshot and see if this jogs your memory. I don't remember if you were... Quiet here for a second. this Here we go. This side.

Let me look in one second.

I remember seeing it, but I don't recall using it too much to like give too much of a feedback on it.

Yeah. Okay, cool. I remember, I think it was like a week ago. a lot from me, but Um... From this format in relation to the spreadsheets, do you like this viewability more or do you find this to be a better view than the spreadsheets or do you not find the information as helpful?

I mean, that definitely visualizes it better than a spreadsheet.

I'll say that. So if you're a more visual person, that works a lot better.

Yeah, I like this one, but I think it was a lot of manual work back in the day to keep up.

Gotcha. Yeah, I mean... It's, either will work, it's just what can you produce at a better rate is probably the better thing you should ask.

Yeah, and I guess like for the spreadsheets, when I gave you your spreadsheet, was that hard for you to get adjusted to? Hello.

Hello I disconnected real quick. I apologize.

No, you're good. But when I gave you your bet tracking spreadsheet, when we switched to the spreadsheet versions, was that an easy tracking method for you?

Yeah, I mean, I had no problem as long as, yeah, like you have access to the computer and shit.

Yeah, it was relatively easy.

I don't remember, what apps were you using to track before? Or like how were you tracking before? Oh, fuck.

Um... I forgot the app's name.

Son of a bitch. Oh, fuck. I don't remember.

Was it, was it Pickett?

Yes.

It was Pickett, yeah. Did you like Pickett more than the Spetsuits or no?

Pickett was okay. It just had too much money it wanted.

Yeah, like for the pro and shit. Mm-hmm. But Did you find the sync aspect to be easier to... to do for the for the um like just the recaps than the spreadsheets or were the spreadsheets just not that much more effort About the same.

Not too much of a difference. Bye. Not enough difference for it to make a huge difference, I guess I could say. Yeah.

Give me one second. It's fine. And then I guess like For the play of the day tracking, and we did that in a spreadsheet too, was that, I know that kind of fell off. Um, So I guess what what about that made that difficult to keep up with?

What do you mean? Like, what made what difficult?

Do you remember the play of the day tracking spreadsheet that I created for last year, 2025? Yeah. But we only had like one month that we actually tracked in it. Do you remember what made that one harder to track in?

I don't. I mean... I don't know. I really couldn't tell you that one. I feel like...

I don't know. That one I really couldn't tell you off the top of my head to give you a good answer for.

Yeah, no, and then I guess like another thing is like back to the analyst channels because I'm trying to try to figure out how to make sure people are posting their daily recaps. So I guess. Yeah. Was that more of a, like, and I noticed some of the days like weren't as winning.

Was it more of a like you didn't want to track or is it you didn't have time?

I feel like it could have been a mix of both, probably mainly the time one or more so.

Because I feel like... I feel like it's easier to get lost into it once you go like one day you don't track and then ends up going like two or three and then you make a recap and then you start making that a habit and that just kind of comes to problem. Yeah.

And like, was... Inputting your bets that you are sending out, into the spreadsheet, would you do that? Like when you post them, also put them in the spreadsheet or would you wait until later?

If I was free, like I was doing the play at home, I'd probably just do it in the computer as I was there and then just fix the win-loss later. If it was like I was doing it out, then I would just be able to win the game then.

Yeah, and I guess like when you do it before it kind of becomes part of your strategy like Mm-hmm. And when you track before, does it make it easier to stay on top of things?

So, yeah, it makes it a lot easier to just go in and press like win, loss or push.

Yeah, and I guess like kind of since you're already posting the play and then copy pasting it in the spreadsheet, does it feel like that much extra work or not?

I feel like it made it a lot more like I didn't want to skip it as much because of how easy it was just to like go in and just press like...

yes or no like once it was already in yeah and I guess for And this might be a little more personal, but were you betting the players? Because I know you don't post the slips as much in the server.

I was betting a good majority of them. The days that I didn't find a lot, then I wouldn't be betting every single one of them.

But the days where I'd have big slates, I was betting a vast 80% to 90% of them. Yeah.

Yeah, and I know I don't always do this, but like when you say your suggested unit size is one unit, do you often follow that yourself?

I follow the unit aspect. I don't follow taking them as singles, typically.

Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. You send them out as singles and then you parlay them, right?

Bingo. but I'll do like a unit on a parlay.

Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Mm-hmm. and then I guess like Okay, yeah, then... For managing your analyst bankroll for your tracking, Since you were placing them all straight, or all parlays and then tracking them straight, did that make it any more difficult?

Not really, because if I was...

doing them as parlays anyway I'd make more than if I did them straight in theory yeah that's kind of Kind of a dumb question because if they're going to win anyways, they're all going to win in the parlay.

Well, yeah. I mean, it's not a dumb question. It's just harder to compare because the payouts would be different. Yeah.

Yeah, and I guess like If you weren't tracking like using the spreadsheet would it still be easy to like one use a unit system and stay disciplined and two like actually know how much you're up?

I mean, if you have an easy unit size, then yeah. If your unit size is a flat number, like 10, 100, or like... Five bucks. And yeah, it's easy to track because like if you go up like because if you say if you bet five to win four, you're up point eight of a unit because that's 80 percent.

It's just stuff like that.

It's easy.

If your unit size is like, well, 46, then yeah, now it's gonna start getting a little harder to calculate the units because now you're betting a unit that...

Can't even divisibly equally do I know Mine isn't as much because I just don't... I just usually only bet the plays that I send. But I guess like... When you're... When you have, I guess I would call it two different bankrolls, one you're tracking in the server bankroll and then two your actual betting bankroll, is it hard to separate those?

Not really. I mean, like...

I personally don't think it's that hard.

I mean, like, you only use a couple apps, so you just...

Yeah.

So it's just, like...

And then also, like... it's easy to track how much you're up or down also because like a lot of these big bookies at least like they have things that literally tell you how much you're up or down.

Yeah, yeah. I mean, do you, I guess like, I, I, I, Cliff doesn't have that shit, so I've never been on like FanDuel to actually see. So do you look at that a lot?

I look at it every so often, not like every day, but every so often I'm curious. To see how my month or how the week has been.

Do you look at it relative to where that number is? Or do you look at it just like... relative to all time.

Mainly per year. Yeah. Like all time, yeah, but like per year is the main. Yeah. Yeah.

And then like When you send plays, like I'll give you an example. If you sent like three plays out and then they all three lost, Do you ever like... Bet but not post.

I mean, yeah, but then those are plays that I'm just betting for my own sake.

Yeah, no. Like I'm not gonna start sending table tennis plays to the fucking chat.

Yeah, you can't be sending out the...

I can't, I can't.

The 3 a.m., I'm off 10 beers and I'm just trying to triple my money real quick. Table tennis.

Yeah, the Japanese, Korean baseball.

Oh, yes. The NC Dinos.

The Dinos. Oh my gosh. Don't get me started on the Dinos. Such a great team. Um, Okay, cool. I think that's like, that's mostly it. I mean, like, The biggest thing I would say is like... That people weren't updating their just keeping consistent with it. And I'm just trying to figure out ways to make it more consistent so that they stick to it more. So I guess like, do you have any last like, What would make this easier for you if you were doing like, I know you're not going to be posting again or like not posting right now, but if you were going to be using the spreadsheet or anything else again, what would your ideal be?

I mean, it's hard because like everything that like I give advice for, they would have to do themselves. It's not something you can do. Like they would just have to like prep themselves and make it easier for themselves. Like make it already like the minute they pick plays to put it in just so they don't have to like go in later Put it all in like it's stuff like that that you can't control that's up to them Yeah, okay, so it's more of like the system is okay, but it's the strategy.

Yeah, the system is fine.

It's just that people have to create their own habits of success to...

make it work for themselves.

Okay, cool. And then could you try to give me a couple good habits that you think you used that were helpful with the spreadsheets? Um...

Earlier the better, just get your stuff in. That's the only big advice I can, earlier the better.

As soon as you have a play, the faster you can get it on the spreadsheet, the easier it's going to make your work later in the day.

And then is there anything that made it like hard to keep up with the spreadsheets?

Not anything that the spreadsheets can control.

But just like mostly on a personal basis of if you get behind.

Just getting lazy, that's really it.

Like I can't really like emphasize Much else besides like it's just laziness is what can really kill you.

Yeah, yeah, okay cool. I think yeah, that's most of Because I think I'm going to keep the spreadsheets as a system because it's really good team tracking. And it's also just like... we drop out DGENs, get the data of like how our analysts are doing in the server. But I just wanted to like kind of, because I don't want it to be a really big burden and reason that like people aren't really committing to and able to keep being an analyst.

Yeah, I get what you're saying. Yeah. Okay, cool. Because, yeah, that was one of my big concerns was that analysts were maybe not using this or like not posting as much because they got behind in the spreadsheet. But would you say that would be a big issue or no? Yeah.

It depends the person. It could be a big issue for some people.

To others, they could easily fix that. It all depends on the person. Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, okay, cool. So yeah, awesome. I think, yeah, that's all the questions I had on that. on the sprite sheets. And then the last thing to just like, and the meeting is just with like, dropout degens with our positioning. So. I just want to kind of throw this by you and hear your thoughts a little bit. Let me actually just, let me throw a screenshot for you. Because you won't have, you won't get access to this, but the staff are going to get access to this.

Okay. And... I guess like I'm gonna just tell you our thoughts and our struggles so far that we've had with like Where we're at and then how I'm planning to solve it and then like I want to hear your thoughts on on this because you've been you've been here with us for a while and also like very open in the aspect that we are acknowledgement that we've were we are very like our community is dying and we're trying to do something to fix itMm-hmm.

So basically what it comes to is One, I am getting all of our, a bunch of documents loaded up. So the first thing I'm doing is I'm, changing our positioning. So we really were just with our partnerships previously, we were just framing it as in sign up for a partner and you get seven free days or 30 free days. But we didn't really deliver any of the value that our partners bring, which is where we were kind of failing.

And we weren't really doing well conversions. So and it's really just the that's where we kind of failed. And so from that, we're kind of changing our positioning to be more revolved around our partnerships. We're building out a lot of more education-focused tools. So we have the unit sizes for the analysts, and that's been kind of our thing for getting our members used to the units. But we're going to make that such a more forward thing of the education behind the units.

This is why you should use units to be more disciplined. actually understand how much you're betting and just to be more profitable. And we're just going to focus on the education behind it. And so with our partners, we're really just going to try to basically Twist the positioning to be This is... We want our members to use our partnerships because they are receiving value from them. So we want to get the integrations into the Discord.

So we're building out, we have the props cache bot, we haven't gotten much use on, we have the outlier insights. And then the big thing, which we're going to update soon is the odd jam EV. But basically, the biggest thing behind that is we want to educate our members. And these are how you use the tools. These are how you use insights. Insights are when these things have happened, over a course of X games and Evie is so-and-so.

And so we want to take those education aspects with our members and be like, so these are actually how you use the tools. So eventually that when they are able to, when they build up their bankroll to be enough to use Odds Jam, that they'll come back for with us and use our code on it. Mm-hmm. So I guess like how does how does that sound in the framing? Good.

So it's fine. I don't really hear anything crazy against it. Okay, cool.

And so the biggest thing on that is we're focusing on conversions. So the biggest thing out of that is we need our staff to be able to actually like convert on our partners. And so. Um, like... I'll just say you, but also all of the staff, except for me, have basically gotten no partner conversions, unless it's been themselves. So right now, I'm trying to build out a different system to encourage more conversions.

So I'm building out one appoint system for conversions. So basically, if you refer anybody to the server, one, I'm giving all the staff custom invite links. And then I convert, they'll get points for. And then additionally, if the staff actually make the action of, hey, you use the dropouts code on underdog and we'll give you free access or do so and so, then they will get the points for the conversion.

And so how the points will work is I'm going to do a 5% bonus. conversion is $100, then you'll get $60.

Mm-hmm.

So I guess like when it comes to conversions, Was there, because you and all the staff didn't have many, so do you mind taking a second to brainstorm on how this sounds and if this would help actually, if you were a staff member, if this would help with conversions? Sure. So like I guess Just From the Pain points of like... Why you didn't get many referrals? Do you have any like thoughts?

I just couldn't use a majority of that. It was harder for me.

Yeah. Yeah the usability. Okay, so The analyst, yeah, that's one of the things that I need to do better job at is actually getting our analysts to use them and actually being they have to be in a legal state for them but like for example um and i know that i floated it but you have your own props cash account but if like i had a company props cash account would that have made it easier for you to like actually screenshot and share props cash playsOh.

In terms of that, no. When I made that easier, no.

So, what do you think would have made it easier?

nothing would make props cash any easier whether it was the account or not like I don't really know any way to make it easier necessarily.

Do you have any ideas for any of the other partners? Okay.

I mean, it's just advertising them. Honestly, that's the big thing, just getting people to see them, that they're in the channel, that they can be used. That's kind of the... I don't feel like there's a problem with anything besides just the advertising of them.

Yes, and so When you say the advertising of them, because we do have, like, the resources and everything.

Things need to be pushed more. That's really it.

Yeah, and so as a staff member, like, what resources could you have used, like, to push them more? Like, what would have helped you push them more?

Just, like, more notifications advertising. I'm like, I...

Okay, so one thing I have in this database is all these partners have like, Let me just DM you this as well. You can just copy it, for example, the promo. If you wanted to send this in Discord, and it sends like that. with like For you as an analyst or as a staff member for helping to market and advertise would having access to this make that easier for you? And do you think you'd use this?

I mean, I probably wouldn't have just because I'm not the biggest tech guy, but... again, to some people that are more tech savvy, that could be very helpful. Yeah, but like...

Depending on like for example if this was in discord would you use it?

I mean...

I wouldn't necessarily use it, but I would see like more posts being made, obviously, because if it's being pushed out more and they're seeing the actual things, like people saying, Hey, like this is here, this is there.

Like, That's the main thing. There's nothing wrong with anything within the apps.

It's just getting them pushed out for people to see them.

Yep. So you need more places to reference them.

I mean, I guess that's one way to word it.

Yeah, or like just, yeah, they need to be more present and they need to be more in a space where you can say, oh yeah, you should use this because... And, okay, so they're not, even though we have them, they're not present enough in all of the channels. So I need to do a better job of getting them in the channels more so that the staff can say, oh yeah, this is a really good resource like that.

Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

Okay. And then anything else, do you think?

Not really, to be honest. I could think of...

That was really helpful feedback. Thank you.

Yeah, of course.

And then, like... The last thing is just... That's all. And the last thing to just end this off is, do you have any friends that you bet with? that aren't in the dropout DGN serverBye.

Not really.

Mainly because I've been so locked at work, I haven't been crazy with betting and stuff like that.

Yeah, but like I guess like do you have a crowd that's outside of dropout D gens? Mm.

I wouldn't say a crowd really not necessarily uh...

and or is and are you still like Are you still good with Migs?

I just so I talked to him every so often but I don't like I'm not like like On the phone with him all the time, not really.

Do you know if he's still, like, doing the betting and all?

He's betting, yeah. uh...

do you know if you'd be like willing to reach out to him and see if he'd be down to come back to drive out Dijon's because I keep messaging him and he keeps rating me so um yeah I'll check in with him I know for a while he hasn't really wanted to do all that but now I'll definitely check in and see what he's doing see if he wants to do anything yeah and like even if he doesn't just if you could like try to get him to come back in the community um and then I'll also give you um if you need help getting anybody free access um what I'm doing right now is who joins that is a real person, I'll give them free access.

They don't have to pay because I'm just trying to increase our premium members. So... If you also have anybody that you just like invite, From like any random server or some shit that you find I will just let me know and I can also get them free premium Okay.

you Sounds good. Awesome.

I'll make those updates in a bit. Yeah, and then you should be set.

Sounds good.

All right. Thanks, Dante. And I hope to still see you around in the server a lot, even as a member. And the play of the days will be greatly appreciated. And I'll keep that group chat with JP still going. Yeah. All right, dude. All right. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. See you. Bye-bye. Thank you.
