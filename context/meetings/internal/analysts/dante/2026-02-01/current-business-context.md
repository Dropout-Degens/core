# Business Context — As of February 1, 2026

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens is repositioning from a picks-focused Discord to an education-first sports betting community. Dax described the community as "dying" and acknowledged they're trying to fix it. The server is currently inactive.

The previous approach — "sign up for a partner and get 7 or 30 free days" — failed to deliver actual value from partnerships and resulted in poor conversion rates. The new positioning focuses on educating members on how to use integrated tools (Props Cache bot, Outlier Insights, OddsJam EV) so they understand the value and eventually convert to paid partnerships.

## Team

- **Dax (CEO):** Managing everything. Has a gap between 11am-1pm, then class and work until 5pm. Struggles to get play of the day posted consistently due to schedule and forgetting after opening Discord DMs.
- **JP (Mod):** Still active. Group chat with JP and Dante continues.
- **Dante (transitioning):** Moving from Head Analyst to All-Access member. Works at a bank with no Discord access on work computers. Available only during lunch breaks or slow moments. Will continue sending play of the day when possible but has no formal responsibilities.
- **Other staff:** Activity is inconsistent. Staff have gotten basically zero partner conversions except converting themselves.

## Revenue

- Revenue is low (not explicitly stated but implied throughout)
- Staff are not getting paid — Dante explicitly said he's not asking for money
- All staff except Dax have gotten basically zero partner conversions
- Conversion failure is attributed to: (1) staff couldn't use partners due to state restrictions, (2) partners weren't visible enough in channels for staff to naturally reference

## Product State

- **Props Cache bot:** Integrated but not getting much use. Dante said nothing would make it easier — the issue is visibility, not the tool itself.
- **Outlier Insights:** Integrated, sends trends.
- **OddsJam EV:** Being updated. Dax is building a fallback system to pull plays from EV data when the play of the day doesn't get sent.
- **Partner database:** Dax has loaded all partners with copy-paste promo text. Staff can copy and paste partner promos into Discord. Dante said he personally wouldn't use it (not tech-savvy) but acknowledged it could help others.
- **Tracking systems:** Spreadsheets are the current system for analyst tracking. They work fine — the issue is personal habits and consistency, not the system itself.

## Staff Tracking Feedback

Dante provided feedback on various tracking systems tried over time:

- **myodds.bet:** Better visualization than spreadsheets but required too much manual work
- **Pickett app:** Okay but wanted too much money for pro features
- **Spreadsheets:** Work fine. Easy to use once plays are entered. Main issue is consistency — missing one day snowballs.

Key insight: "The system is fine. It's just that people have to create their own habits of success."

## Conversion System

Dax is building a point-based conversion incentive:
- Staff get custom invite links (tracked)
- Points for referring someone to the server
- Points for converting someone onto a partner
- 5% bonus pool distributed based on points earned

## Strategic Direction

1. Finish education-first repositioning — focus on teaching members how to use tools
2. Get partners more visible in channels so staff can naturally reference them
3. Build EV-based fallback for play of the day
4. Give free premium generously to grow the member base
5. Revisit inactive staff roles in 1-2 months

## Key Blockers

- Staff can't use many partners due to state restrictions (Connecticut in Dante's case)
- Partners aren't visible enough in channels for staff to reference naturally
- Staff activity is inconsistent
- Play of the day timing is unreliable — neither Dax nor Dante has a system that works consistently
- Conversion rates are near zero across all staff except Dax
