# Dante Ongoing Expectations — As of December 27, 2025

---

## Role

Head Analyst (role structure under review — may shift toward more engagement-focused, less daily posting)

## Current Expectations

- **Play of the day by noon daily.** This is the one hard KPI. JP is backup if Dante can't deliver.
- **Send plays as text, not screenshots.** Enables automatic tracking.
- **Active in 5 channels:** General chat, Dante's picks, members chat, basketball, football.
- **React in 3 channels:** Daily free picks, play of the day (check/X), greened out (supportive reactions).
- **Education-first framing:** When posting picks, reference tools and research in sport-specific channels. Don't just post the pick — explain the reasoning and which partner tools informed it.

## Open Questions

- Dante's long-term role is unresolved. He wants to reduce daily posting obligations but hasn't defined what he'd do instead. Dax is open to restructuring but needs a concrete proposal.
- Engagement level is the core concern — not whether Dante posts picks, but whether he's present and active in the community.

## Compensation

Analyst revenue share (approximately 10% of net profit split across analyst group). Specifics to be revisited as role structure evolves.
