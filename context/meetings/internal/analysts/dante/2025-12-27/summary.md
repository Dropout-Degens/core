# Dante 1:1 Summary — December 27, 2025

**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (CEO), Dante (Head Analyst)
**Purpose:** Capacity check-in, POTD workflow, education-first pivot walkthrough, roadmap overview, KPI setting

---

## Capacity

Dante works 8am-4pm at a desk job with co-workers around him. He can sneak onto Discord briefly but does not have 2+ hours of availability during work. He expressed interest in stepping back from daily analyst posting and moving toward "back end" tasks likea getting the POTD out rather than being active in channels six or seven days a week. He will still post plays opportunistically when he sees lines he likes, but does not want a daily obligation.

Dax acknowledged this but flagged that the real blocker is not the picks themselves — it's overall engagement. If Dante steps away from analyst duties, equivalent community engagement would still be needed. Dante agreed to assess his work situation on Monday (December 29th) and report back on whether he can access Discord at work.

## POTD Workflow

A new automated workflow was agreed on:
- Dante sends POTD by **noon**
- Dax creates graphic and posts to Discord by **1:30pm**
- Bot script auto-posts to Twitter and Instagram at **2pm**
- JP serves as backup — sends a play by **1pm** if Dante can't get his out

Dax also requested Dante send plays as **text messages** rather than screenshots. This enables future automatic tracking and looks better for members.

## Education-First Pivot

Dax walked Dante through the same positioning shift presented to JP the day before. The key ask for Dante as an analyst: don't just post picks — reference the tools and research behind them in the sport-specific channels (e.g., "I'm liking this in Dante's Plays because of the stats I found on partner XYZ"). The goal is to shift conversations from "take this because I said so" to "take this because of this research."

## Roadmap

Same wave-based roadmap as JP meeting:
- **Wave 1 (by January 1st):** Education content, staff onboarding, Fliff EV live, invite link refresh, Discord cleanup
- **Wave 2 (January):** Retention features (karma, polls, partner promo bot), ticket system, pricing increase to $50/month
- **Wave 3 (February):** Full EV release across all platforms, conversion optimization, scaling
- **Wave 4 (post-February):** Marketing and growth push

Dante's role in the roadmap: lead education-focused conversations in general chat, betting floor, and premium community channels. Encourage smarter betting discussion and reference partnerships naturally.

## KPIs Set

**5 channels to be active in:**
1. General chat
2. Dante's picks channel
3. Members chat
4. Basketball
5. Football

**3 channels to react in:**
1. Daily free picks
2. Play of the day (check/X reactions)
3. Greened out (supportive reactions on member wins)

**Hard KPI:** Play of the day sent by noon daily.

## Role Discussion — Unresolved

Dante wants to reduce daily posting obligations. Dax is open to restructuring the role but needs Dante to come back with a concrete proposal for what he'd do instead. The concern is that without daily analyst activity, Dante still needs to contribute meaningful engagement. This is explicitly left open for the follow-up meeting.

## Follow-Up

Tuesday, December 30th at 7pm. Dante to assess work Discord access on Monday and come prepared to discuss how his role could evolve within the education-first vision.
