# Business Context — As of December 27, 2025

---

## Company State

Same state as JP meeting the day prior. Dropout Degens is mid-pivot to education-first positioning. Discord content and channels do not yet reflect the new direction. Wave 1 target is January 1st.

## Team

- Dax (CEO) — managing all operations, balancing job and school
- Dante (Head Analyst) — 2 years with the company, constrained by 8am-4pm desk job, wants to step back from daily posting
- JP — mod, very low capacity until January 12th job transition
- Overall staff engagement is low across the board; Dax acknowledged this is not unique to Dante

## POTD Workflow (New)

Dante sends by noon → Dax posts graphic by 1:30pm → Bot auto-posts to socials at 2pm. JP is backup by 1pm. This workflow was established on this call.

## Key Concern

Dante is the first analyst being re-onboarded into the new vision. His capacity and willingness to engage daily is uncertain. If Dante can't maintain engagement, Dax may need to find additional analyst support or restructure the analyst role entirely. Dax noted that in a fallback scenario, he could serve as the sole analyst over the summer — but does not want to.

## Revenue / Product

No changes from JP meeting context. Subscription revenue minimal, no active partnership revenue being collected. Fliff EV scheduled to go live. Price increase to $50/month contingent on delivering the full value proposition.
