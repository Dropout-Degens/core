# Dante — Current Context

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026
**Role:** All-Access Member (formerly Head Analyst)
**Status:** Stepped back — minimal responsibilities, revisit in 1-2 months

---

## Background

Dante was a Head Analyst for Dropout Degens. He works at a bank in Connecticut. His schedule has him out of the house at 8am and home between 4pm and 6pm. Discord is completely blocked on work computers — they run locked-down software where even Cool Math Games is blocked. The only "fun" site allowed is ESPN.

He can only contribute during lunch breaks or slow moments when there are no customers. His energy after work is inconsistent — some days he's awake and ready, other days he just wants to go to bed.

## Role Transition

Dante acknowledged he can't provide as much as he used to. He didn't ask for specific roles or money. He offered to continue play of the day until someone else can take over, then "pass the torch." He didn't want to just leave out of nowhere.

Dax offered a mod role focused on evening engagement, but Dante didn't want to give false hope about his availability. They agreed to move him to All-Access member with no formal responsibilities, keeping his staff badge as recognition.

**Timeline:**
- Dec 27, 2025: POTD workflow established (Dante by noon, JP backup by 1pm). Wanted to step back from daily analyst posting toward "back end" tasks.
- Feb 1, 2026: Officially transitioned from Head Analyst to All-Access member.

## Current Expectations

Minimal:
- **Play of the day:** Send when possible. No deadline, but before noon is preferred. Appreciated but not required.
- **Community presence:** Be active when energy allows. No KPIs.
- **Member recruitment:** Reach out to Migs (former member) about rejoining. Invite anyone who bets.

## Compensation

**None.** Dante explicitly said he's not asking for money given his limited availability. He keeps his staff badge (yellow "Alexis" role) as recognition.

## Review Period

Revisit in 1-2 months. If Dante is active in the community as a member and his schedule allows, he may return to the mod team with more formal responsibilities.

## Feedback Provided

Dante gave valuable feedback on analyst tracking systems:

**On spreadsheets:**
- The system is fine — the problem is personal habits
- "Earlier the better" — input plays immediately, don't wait
- Once a play is in the spreadsheet, marking win/loss/push is easy
- Missing one day snowballs into multiple missed days
- "Laziness is what can really kill you"

**On conversions:**
- He couldn't use most partners due to Connecticut restrictions
- Partners need more visibility in channels — the tools exist but aren't present enough for staff to naturally reference
- A company Props Cache account wouldn't have helped — the issue is visibility, not access

**On myodds.bet vs Pickett vs spreadsheets:**
- myodds.bet: Better visualization but too much manual work
- Pickett: Okay but wanted too much money for pro features
- Spreadsheets: Work fine, main issue is consistency

## Connections

- **Migs:** Former member. Dante talks to him occasionally. Migs is still betting but has been ignoring Dax's messages. Dante agreed to reach out.
