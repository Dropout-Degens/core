# Kronos — Current Context

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026
**Role:** Analyst
**Status:** Active — just onboarded

---

## Background

Kronos is based in California. He works a day job (schedule ends around 3:30 PM PST). He runs his own small Discord server (~150 members, started late December) but it's mostly inactive — Iceman is the main active analyst there. Kronos said he'll put more effort into DD than his own server since his is free.

He was away last month and hasn't been as active as he should have been. This onboarding call was the reset.

## Current Role & Expectations

**Analyst** — picks with education, partner promotion, member engagement

- **Daily picks:** Post picks after 3:30 PM PST on weekdays, all day on weekends. Include reasoning and unit sizing.
- **Screenshots:** Send screenshots of bets referencing DD partner apps where possible (limited by California location).
- **Member engagement:** Respond to pings during work hours for member questions. Full pick submissions after work.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 per month required. Tag user + app name in partner attribution channel.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep 2026 spreadsheet up to date once received.
- **Recruitment:** Funnel members from his own server to DD. Connect analyst prospects with Dax.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue (requires 5 conversions/month)
- **Under 5 conversions:** Only eligible for 5% staff bonus pool
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points
- **Point values vary by partner** based on commission value
- **Invite link premium joins:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** Invite + convert same person

## Access & Setup

- [ ] Tracked invite link sent
- [ ] Bet tracking spreadsheet sent (Dax to backfill 2026)
- [ ] ChatGPT link for formatting bet data sent
- [ ] Documentation on compensation/conversion system sent

## Tools & Research

- **Props Cash / Outlier** (shared subscription with a buddy)
- **DGF** (shared account through a different server, ~3 people)
- Various websites for player prop analysis (time on court, player management, matchup effects)

## Unique Value

- **Own Discord server (~150 members):** Willing to funnel members to DD with 30-day free access offer
- **Analyst referrals:** Has connections to three potential analysts:
  - **Iceman** — most active in Kronos's server, previously referred to Dax
  - **Baseball analyst** — inactive due to offseason, expected back when season starts
  - **Multi-sport analyst** — covers basketball, football, baseball
- **Player prop depth:** Does in-depth analysis on player time management, court time, and how it affects props

## Unique Considerations

- **California location:** Limits personal access to many DD partner apps
- **Shared accounts:** Props Cash/Outlier and DGF are shared with others, not DD company accounts
- **Was away last month:** Acknowledged being less active. This call was the onboarding reset.
