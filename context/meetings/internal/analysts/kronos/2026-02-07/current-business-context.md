# Business Context — As of February 7, 2026 (Kronos 1:1)

---

## Company State

Dropout Degens community is currently dead. Dax is going through members one by one, messaging previous subscribers to try to bring them back. The core problem is a circular inactivity issue: not enough community members for staff to be active, not enough staff activity for members to stay, not enough members for the community to feel alive.

Dax is also limited by school and work during the day, so outreach happens mostly in the evenings.

## Staff Goals (Q1 2026)

1. **Culture adoption:** Staff using partners, pushing conversions, educating members
2. **Retention:** Strengthen brand identity, keep members engaged when they come back
3. **Conversions:** Increase partner conversion rates

## Compensation Model

- **Staff base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month to qualify for base
- **Under 5 conversions:** Bonus pool only, no 2% base
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points at end of month
- **Point values:** Vary by partner (e.g., Parley Play = 5 pts) based on commission value
- **Invite link premium joins:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** Invite + convert same person
- **Dax excluded** from bonus pool

## Analyst Positioning

The analyst role is being repositioned beyond just picks:
- Education and reasoning behind every pick
- Screenshots of bets referencing DD partner apps
- Line shopping education — directing members to better lines on partner platforms
- Free signup bonus awareness — teaching members to take advantage of partner offers

## New Analyst Pipeline

Dax considering picking up additional analysts. Kronos has referred:
- **Iceman** — most active analyst in Kronos's server (previously sent to Dax)
- **Baseball analyst** — inactive due to offseason, expected back when season starts
- **Multi-sport analyst** — covers basketball, football, baseball

Dax mentioned he may base new analysts (not previously on the team) at 10% rather than 2%, but still thinking through this.

## Server Acquisition

Kronos runs a small Discord (~150 members, started late December). Mostly inactive. Kronos offered to post DD's invite link and tell members to come over with a 30-day free all-access offer. This fits DD's broader strategy of bringing in members from wherever possible to rebuild the community base.
