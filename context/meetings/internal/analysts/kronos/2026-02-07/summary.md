**Attendees:** Dax Nguyen (Founder), Kronos (Analyst)
**Purpose:** Onboarding check-in, scheduling, analyst positioning, conversion system walkthrough, server acquisition discussion
**Note:** Kronos was on a trip during this call but agreed to proceed

---

## Schedule & Availability

- **Monday–Friday:** Available after 3:30 PM PST (6:00 PM EST)
- **Saturday–Sunday:** Available all day
- **During work:** Can answer questions and talk about plays if pinged, but can't do full research/pick submissions

## Analyst Positioning

Dax explained the repositioning of analyst roles beyond just picks:
- Education behind picks (unit sizing, reasoning)
- Screenshot bets and reference which DD partner app is relevant
- Push the value of line shopping, free signup bonuses, and partner resources
- Kronos is in California, which makes the screenshot/partner aspect harder since he has limited access to many apps

## Tools & Research

Kronos's current research stack:
- **Props Cash** (paid subscription — shared account with a buddy, same as Outlier)
- **DGF account** (through a different server — shared between ~3 people)
- **Various websites** for in-depth player prop analysis — time on court, player management, etc.
- Uses Outlier or similar apps to visualize his research

## Conversion Points System

Dax walked through the same system as other analysts:
- All DD partners in a database with point values (e.g., Parley Play = 5 points)
- 5% staff bonus pool distributed proportionally by points at end of month
- Example: $100 pool, 7 out of 10 total points = $70
- Dax is excluded from the bonus pool

### Invite Link
- Kronos receiving a unique tracked invite link
- Anyone who joins through his link and gets converted = Kronos gets the points even if Dax does the conversion
- If Kronos both invites AND converts = double points (5 + 5)
- Premium joins via invite link = 3 conversion points

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue
- **Requirement:** 5 conversions per month to qualify for 2% base
- **Under 5 conversions:** Only eligible for staff bonus pool, not the 2% base
- Kronos confirmed he understood

## Server Acquisition Opportunity

Kronos runs his own small Discord server (~150 members, started late December). It's not very active. Key details:
- **Iceman** is the most active analyst in Kronos's server — Kronos previously sent him to Dax as a potential recruit
- Kronos offered to post DD's invite link in his server and tell members to come over
- Dax will set up a 30-day free all-access offer for members who join from Kronos's server
- Kronos said he'll put more effort into DD than his own server since his is free

### Additional Analyst Referrals
Kronos has two other potential analysts from his server:
1. A **baseball-focused analyst** — inactive because baseball is out of season, should be back when it starts up
2. A **multi-sport analyst** — covers basketball, football, baseball
- Kronos will reach out to both and connect them with Dax

## Bet Tracking

- Dax will set up 2026 bet tracking spreadsheet for Kronos (backfilling previous picks)
- Will also provide a ChatGPT link for formatting bet data into the spreadsheet
- Required to keep updated once received

## Upcoming

- Dax planning to set up weekly analyst meetings (after next week, once all info/docs are sent out)
- Dax to send documentation covering everything discussed in the analyst group chat

## Key Outcomes

- Kronos's schedule established: weekday evenings + all day weekends
- Conversion system and compensation structure explained and agreed upon
- Kronos offering to funnel his ~150-member server into DD with 30-day free access offer
- Two additional analyst referrals identified (baseball guy + multi-sport guy)
- Iceman previously referred and being considered
