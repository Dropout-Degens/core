# Kronos Ongoing Expectations — As of February 7, 2026

---

## Role

Analyst

## Schedule

- **Monday–Friday:** Available after 3:30 PM PST / 6:00 PM EST
- **Saturday–Sunday:** Available all day
- **During work:** Can respond to pings and answer member questions, but can't do full pick research/submissions

## Current Expectations

- **Analyst picks:** Post picks with education behind them — unit sizing, reasoning, research process. Not just the pick itself.
- **Screenshots:** Send screenshots of bets and reference DD partner apps. Harder for Kronos since he's in California with limited partner access, but do what's possible.
- **Partner promotion:** Push line shopping value, free signup bonuses, and partner resources when relevant.
- **Conversions:** Minimum 5 per month to qualify for 2% base. Tag user + app name in partner attribution channel with proof.
- **Bet tracking:** Keep 2026 spreadsheet up to date once received from Dax. ChatGPT link provided for formatting.
- **Member questions:** Be responsive to pings during work hours when possible.
- **Recruitment:** Post DD invite link in own server. Connect potential analysts with Dax.

## Compensation

- **Base:** 2% of monthly subscription + partnership revenue (requires 5 conversions/month)
- **Under 5 conversions:** Only eligible for 5% staff bonus pool
- **5% staff bonus pool:** Distributed proportionally by conversion points
- **Point values vary by partner** based on commission value
- **Invite link premium joins:** 3 points each
- **Double points:** Invite + convert same person
- **Dax excluded** from bonus pool

## Unique Considerations

- **California location:** Limits personal access to many DD partners. Makes screenshot/partner promotion aspect harder but not impossible.
- **Own Discord server:** ~150 members, started late December. Mostly inactive. Kronos willing to funnel members to DD with free access offer. Plans to be more active in DD than his own server.
- **Shared tool accounts:** Props Cash/Outlier and DGF accounts shared with others through a different server. Not DD company accounts.
- **Analyst referrals:** Has connections to Iceman (active), a baseball analyst, and a multi-sport analyst who may join DD.
- **Was away last month:** Acknowledged being less active than expected. This call was the reset.
