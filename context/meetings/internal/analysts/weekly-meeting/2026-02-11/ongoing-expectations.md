# Weekly Analyst Meeting — Ongoing Expectations (February 11, 2026)

**Applies to:** Luke (Analyst), Kaiden (Analyst)

---

## Primary Expectations (This Meeting)

### 1. Partner App Screenshots & Organic Promotion
- Use company accounts (OddsJam for Kaiden, DGF for both) to share platform screenshots in relevant channels
- Don't need to actually place bets — screenshots and organic mentions are enough
- Frame as unofficial/personal: e.g., "I found this line on OddsJam, playing it at half a unit personally" in NBA chat
- Goal is getting partner app visibility in front of members to drive conversions

### 2. Unit Size Calculator Adoption
- Use the unit size calculator yourself this week
- When members ask about units or bankroll, direct them to the calculator in betting tips
- DD needs the usage data from this tool

### 3. EV Alert Engagement
- Monitor EV alert channels for Dax's filtered picks
- Reference picks when chatting with members
- Encourage members to use "place this bet" feature — generates user data DD needs
- NHL filters coming after All-Star break; NBA and March Madness focus next

### 4. Welcome Ticket Engagement
- New members get auto-created welcome tickets
- Engage with tickets when you have time — especially on weekends
- Identify member pain points: what app to use, bankroll management, etc.
- Direct members to relevant server resources
- Messaging framework coming soon (copy-paste guide from Dax)

### 5. Daily Poll
- Vote every day — no exceptions
- If JP misses posting the poll, Dax will step in, but analysts still need to participate

### 6. Partner Signups
- Both analysts are in DFS-legal states — eligible for bonuses on most partner apps
- Check out the partners page and sign up for apps you want to try
- **Tell Dax before signing up** so he can track it for points
- Staff signups get double points

## Community Engagement Priority

Dax emphasized that community engagement is the prerequisite for everything else. Social media expansion, ad spend scaling, and new member acquisition all depend on having an active community for new members to land in. The server has been getting more active over the past few weeks with staff back on board, but needs to continue improving.

## Guerrilla Marketing
- Both analysts asked to brainstorm low-cost acquisition ideas
- Current tactics are cheap and working (DraftKings Discord, Fliff server, Hive Index)
- Open to creative approaches — text Dax with ideas

## Communication
- Text Dax directly if anything is needed
- Report issues with in-server tools
- Share guerrilla marketing ideas when they come up
- Notify Dax when signing up for partner apps

## What's Coming Next Meeting
- Dashboards and user data visualizations
- Company home / Routine workspace access for analysts
- More structured information on partner CRM pipeline
