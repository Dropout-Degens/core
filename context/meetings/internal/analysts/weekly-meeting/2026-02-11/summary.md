## Meeting Overview

Dax led a structured update meeting for analysts covering the current partner ecosystem, new development features, EV alert system, growth marketing, and near-term expectations. This was primarily informational — Dax presenting what's been built and what's coming, with some Q&A at the end.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Partner Dashboard Walkthrough

Dax screen-shared the partner dashboard showing all current partners:
- **Bet tracking tools (2):** Picket, Real
- **Betting tools (4):** All have integrations; any new betting tool partner must include an integration
- **DFS apps (7):** Active category
- **Funded account apps (2):** Mostly inactive; Optimal lost their integration
- **Offshore sportsbooks (2):** MyBookie, Bet105
- **Peer exchanges (3):** ProfitX, Cut, Novig Cut — considering dropping Cut (~$1 per referral)
- **Polymarket:** Code exists but not legal to promote
- **Social sportsbooks (6):** Stimmy and Bronco releasing this week, both analysts eligible

### 2. Active Outreach / Prospects

Currently reaching out to: Drafters, STEMI (code in progress), Better (when Luke turns 21), EPIC (considering), Owner's Box, 4CX (social sportsbook), Baraco (just signed), ParlayEye (DFS app), Props Madness (in outreach)

### 3. Company Account Setup

- Current company accounts: OddsJam, DGF
- Working on getting Outlier and Props accounts back
- **Kaiden** → getting OddsJam access (expressed interest, willing to take screenshots and share)
- **Luke** → getting DGF access (no objections)
- Both getting DGF accounts to explore DFS

### 4. EV Alerts System

- Receiving ~2,000 alerts/day from DGF and ~600/day from OddsChamp
- Dax filtering using sports data API from his Layup internship
- Building filters targeting 60-70% hit rate
- Already sharing semi-official filtered picks in betting channels
- Teased the 2025 hockey EV results — tracked and documented
- NHL filters launching after All-Star break; NBA and March Madness focus next
- Analysts should reference these picks and encourage members to use "place this bet" feature

### 5. Custom Invite Link Tracking

- Every staff member now has a tracked custom invite link
- System is "super beta" — data not yet in main database
- Will eventually track source domain for each user join
- Currently tracking joins from sources like Hive Index

### 6. Welcome Ticket System

- New server joins automatically get a welcome ticket
- Staff can engage with new members through these tickets
- Dax may ping staff on some tickets
- Good opportunity for conversion conversations, especially on weekends

### 7. Messaging Framework (Coming Soon)

- Dax building a copy-paste messaging guide for staff
- Focus on identifying member pain points (finding apps, bankroll management)
- Direct members to relevant server resources

### 8. Bet Tracking Tool Demo

- Dax demoed a bet tracking tool from his Layup internship
- Screenshot-based bet logging with automatic tracking
- Can tag bets, mark wins/losses, track individual legs
- Demoed using Reina's bet as example
- Potential Discord bot integration coming
- Release timeline uncertain (depends on Layup permissions)

### 9. Growth Marketing

- **Hive Index:** $200 spend, ~400 clicks at ~$0.50 CPC, #1 promoted in Sports Betting category
- **DraftKings Discord:** $3/month for profile invite link; ~50 joins (half bots), ~25 real — excellent ROI
- **Fliff server:** 1-4 organic joins/day, all funnel directly to DD server (Luke confirmed he's in this server too)
- **Social media:** Not expanding yet — want community engagement proven first
- **Strategy:** 2 months validating acquisition sources before committing $5-10K ad spend
- Solicited guerrilla marketing ideas from analysts — neither had suggestions but will think on it

### 10. Daily Poll & Miscellaneous

- JP missed the daily poll; Dax will step in when it's missed
- Both analysts asked to vote on daily polls consistently
- Both are in DFS-legal states — eligible for partner signup bonuses with double points

## Key Outcomes

- Analysts now have visibility into full partner pipeline and business development
- Company account assignments made (OddsJam → Kaiden, DGF → both)
- Clear expectations set for near-term engagement priorities
- Next meeting will include dashboards and data + company home access
