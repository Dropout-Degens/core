- **Assignments:** OddsJam → Kaiden, DGF → both Luke and Kaiden

### Partner Notes
- Polymarket code exists but not legal to promote
- Cut may be dropped — negligible revenue (~$1 per referral)
- All new betting tool partnerships require integration

## EV Alerts & Data Pipeline

- **Volume:** ~2,000 alerts/day from DGF + ~600/day from OddsChamp
- **Data source:** Sports data API via Dax's Layup internship
- **Current state:** Dax manually filtering and sharing semi-official picks in betting channels
- **Target accuracy:** 60-70% hit rate on filtered alerts
- **NHL:** Filters launching after All-Star break; tracked 2025 hockey EV results already documented
- **NBA/March Madness:** Next focus area after NHL launch
- **User data:** "Place this bet" feature collecting usage data on filtered picks

## Growth & Marketing

### Active Acquisition Channels
| Channel | Cost | Performance |
|---|---|---|
| Hive Index | $200/month | ~400 clicks at $0.50 CPC, #1 in Sports Betting |
| DraftKings Discord | $3/month | ~50 joins (half bots), ~25 real — strong ROI |
| Fliff/Flip server | Free | 1-4 organic joins/day, all funnel to DD |

### Strategy
- **Current phase:** Guerrilla marketing, low-cost validation
- **Next phase (~2 months):** Validate sources with data
- **Scale phase:** $5-10K ad spend in best-performing channel
- **Social media:** Not expanding yet — need community engagement proven first
